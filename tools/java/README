Esciurus is a library to manipulate EPUBs. See <https://esciurus.sourceforge.net>. Hasn't been touched in nearly 20 years, but good enough for our purposes, with a couple of minor changes (not requiring the presence of some attributes).

afe.jar, aglj40.jar and rideau.jar are/were part of the FlashBuilder SDK. They are used to subset fonts.
