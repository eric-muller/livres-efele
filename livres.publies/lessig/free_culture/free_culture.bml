<h1 id="preface">PREFACE</h1>

<p><b>At the end</b> of his review of my first book, <i>Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace,</i> David Pogue, a brilliant writer and author of countless technical and computer-related texts, wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike actual law, Internet software has no capacity to punish. It doesn’t affect people who aren’t online (and only a tiny minority of the world population is). And if you don’t like the Internet’s system, you can always flip off the modem.<noteref noteid='note.pref1'/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pogue was skeptical of the core argument of the book—that software,
 or “code,” functioned as a kind of law—and his review suggested the
 happy thought that if life in cyberspace got bad, we could always
 “drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome”-like simply flip a switch and be
 back home. Turn off the modem, unplug the computer, and any troubles
 that exist in <i>that</i> space wouldn’t “affect” us anymore.</p>

<p>Pogue might have been right in 1999—I’m skeptical, but maybe. But
 even if he was right then, the point is not right now: <i>Free Culture</i>
 is about the troubles the Internet causes even after the modem is
 turned off. It is an argument about how the battles that now rage
 regarding life on-line have fundamentally affected “people who aren’t
 online.” There is no switch that will insulate us from the Internet’s
 effect.</p>
<p>But unlike <i>Code,</i> the argument here is not much about the
 Internet itself. It is instead about the consequence of the Internet to
 a part of our tradition that is much more fundamental, and, as hard as
 this is for a geek-wanna-be to admit, much more important.</p>
<p>That tradition is the way our culture gets made. As I explain in the
 pages that follow, we come from a tradition of “free culture”—not
 “free” as in “free beer” (to borrow a phrase from the founder of the
 free- software movement<noteref noteid='note.pref2'/>), but “free” as in 
 “free speech,” “free markets,” “free trade,”, “free enterprise,”
 “free will,” and “free elections.” A free culture supports and
 protects creators and innovators. It does this directly by granting
 intellectual property rights. But it does so indirectly by limiting the
 reach of those rights, to guarantee that follow-on creators and
 innovators remain <i>as free as possible</i> from the control of the
 past. A free culture is not a culture without property, just as a free
 market is not a market in which everything is free. The opposite of a
 free culture is a “permission culture”—a culture in which creators get
 to create only with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from
 the past.</p>
<p>If we understood this change, I believe we would resist it. Not “we” 
 on the Left or “you” on the Right, but we who have no stake in the
 particular industries of culture that defined the twentieth century.
 Whether you are on the Left or the Right, if you are in this sense
 disinterested, then the story I tell here will trouble you. For the
 changes I describe affect values that both sides of our political
 culture deem fundamental.</p>
<p>We saw a glimpse of this bipartisan outrage in the early summer of
 2003. As the FCC considered changes in media ownership rules that would
 relax limits on media concentration, an extraordinary coalition
 generated more than 700,000 letters to the FCC opposing the change. As
 William Safire described marching “uncomfortably alongside CodePink
 Women for Peace and the National Rifle Association, between liberal
 Olympia Snowe and conservative Ted Stevens,” he formulated perhaps most
 simply just what was at stake: the concentration of power. And as he
 asked,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does that sound unconservative? Not to me. The concentration of
 power—political, corporate, media, cultural—should be anathema to
 conservatives. The diffusion of power through local control, thereby
 encouraging individual participation, is the essence of federalism and
 the greatest expression of democracy.<noteref noteid='note.pref3'/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idea is an element of the argument of <i>Free Culture,</i>
 though my focus is not just on the concentration of power produced by
 concentrations in ownership, but more importantly, if because less
 visibly, on the concentration of power produced by a radical change in
 the effective scope of the law. The law is changing; that change is
 altering the way our culture gets made; that change should worry
 you—whether or not you care about the Internet, and whether you’re on
 Safire’s left or on his right.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>The inspiration</b> for the title and for much of the argument of
 this book comes from the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Software
 Foundation. Indeed, as I reread Stallman’s own work, especially the
 essays in <i>Free Software, Free Society,</i> I realize that all of the
 theoretical insights I develop here are insights Stallman described
 decades ago. One could thus well argue that this work is “merely” 
 derivative.</p>
<p>I accept that criticism, if indeed it is a criticism. The work of a
 lawyer is always derivative, and I mean to do nothing more in this book
 than to remind a culture about a tradition that has always been its
 own. Like Stallman, I defend that tradition on the basis of values.
 Like Stallman, I believe those are the values of freedom. And like
 Stallman, I believe those are values of our past that will need to be
 defended in our future. A free culture has been our past, but it will
 only be our future if we change the path we are on right now.</p>
<p>Like Stallman’s arguments for free software, an argument for free
 culture stumbles on a confusion that is hard to avoid, and even harder
 to understand. A free culture is not a culture without property; it is
 not a culture in which artists don’t get paid. A culture without
 property, or in which creators can’t get paid, is anarchy, not freedom.
 Anarchy is not what I advance here.</p>
<p>Instead, the free culture that I defend in this book is a balance
 between anarchy and control. A free culture, like a free market, is
 filled with property. It is filled with rules of property and contract
 that get enforced by the state. But just as a free market is perverted
 if its property becomes feudal, so too can a free culture be queered by
 extremism in the property rights that define it. That is what I fear
 about our culture today. It is against that extremism that this book is
 written.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>


<p><b>On December 17, 1903,</b> on a windy North Carolina beach for just
 shy of one hundred seconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a
 heavier-than-air, self-propelled vehicle could fly. The moment was
 electric and its importance widely understood. Almost immediately,
 there was an explosion of interest in this newfound technology of
 manned flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build upon it.</p>

<p>At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American law
 held that a property owner presumptively owned not just the surface of
 his land, but all the land below, down to the center of the earth, and
 all the space above, to “an indefinite extent, upwards.”<noteref noteid='note.intro1'/>
 For many years, scholars had puzzled about how best to interpret the
 idea that rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean that you
 owned the stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and
 regular trespass?</p>

<p>Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of
 American law—deep within the foundations of our tradition, and
 acknowledged by the most important legal thinkers of our
 past—mattered. If my land reaches to the heavens, what happens when
 United flies over my field? Do I have the right to banish it from my
 property? Am I allowed to enter into an exclusive license with Delta
 Airlines? Could we set up an auction to decide how much these rights
 are worth?</p>

<p>In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Carolina
 farmers Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens because of
 low-flying military aircraft (the terrified chickens apparently flew
 into the barn walls and died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit saying that
 the government was trespassing on their land. The airplanes, of course,
 never touched the surface of the Causbys’ land. But if, as Blackstone,
 Kent, and Coke had said, their land reached to “an indefinite extent,
 upwards,” then the government was trespassing on their property, and
 the Causbys wanted it to stop.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys’ case. Congress had
 declared the airways public, but if one’s property really extended to
 the heavens, then Congress’s declaration could well have been an
 unconstitutional “taking” of property without compensation. The Court
 acknowledged that “it is ancient doctrine that common law ownership of
 the land extended to the periphery of the universe.” But Justice
 Douglas had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single paragraph,
 hundreds of years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the
 Court,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a public
 highway, as Congress has declared. Were that not true, every
 transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless
 trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea. To recognize such
 private claims to the airspace would clog these highways, seriously
 interfere with their control and development in the public interest,
 and transfer into private ownership that to which only the public has a
 just claim.<noteref noteid='note.intro2'/></p>
</blockquote>


<p>“Common sense revolts at the idea.”</p>

<p>This is how the law usually works. Not often this abruptly or
 impatiently, but eventually, this is how it works. It was Douglas’s
 style not to dither. Other justices would have blathered on for pages
 to reach the conclusion that Douglas holds in a single line: “Common
 sense revolts at the idea.” But whether it takes pages or a few words,
 it is the special genius of a common law system, as ours is, that the
 law adjusts to the technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it
 changes. Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age crumble in
 another.</p>
<p>Or at least, this is how things happen when there’s no one powerful
 on the other side of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And
 though there were no doubt many like them who were upset by the growing
 traffic in the air (though one hopes not many chickens flew themselves
 into walls), the Causbys of the world would find it very hard to unite
 and stop the idea, and the technology, that the Wright brothers had
 birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into the technological meme
 pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken coop; farmers like
 the Causbys found themselves surrounded by “what seemed reasonable” 
 given the technology that the Wrights had produced. They could stand on
 their farms, dead chickens in hand, and shake their fists at these
 newfangled technologies all they wanted. They could call their
 representatives or even file a lawsuit. But in the end, the force of
 what seems “obvious” to everyone else—the power of “common
 sense”—would prevail. Their “private interest” would not be allowed to
 defeat an obvious public gain.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Edwin Howard Armstrong</b> is one of America’s forgotten inventor geniuses. He came to the
 great American inventor scene just after the titans Thomas Edison and
 Alexander Graham Bell. But his work in the area of radio technology was
 perhaps the most important of any single inventor in the first fifty
 years of radio. He was better educated than Michael Faraday, who as a
 bookbinder’s apprentice had discovered electric induction in 1831. But
 he had the same intuition about how the world of radio worked, and on
 at least three occasions, Armstrong invented profoundly important
 technologies that advanced our understanding of radio.</p>


<p>On the day after Christmas, 1933, four patents were issued to
 Armstrong for his most significant invention—FM radio. Until then,
 consumer radio had been amplitude-modulated (AM) radio. The theorists
 of the day had said that frequency-modulated (FM) radio could never
 work. They were right about FM radio in a narrow band of spectrum. But
 Armstrong discovered that frequency-modulated radio in a wide band of
 spectrum would deliver an astonishing fidelity of sound, with much less
 transmitter power and static.</p>


<p>On November 5, 1935, he demonstrated the technology at a meeting of
 the Institute of Radio Engineers at the Empire State Building in New
 York City. He tuned his radio dial across a range of AM stations, until
 the radio locked on a broadcast that he had arranged from seventeen
 miles away. The radio fell totally silent, as if dead, and then with a
 clarity no one else in that room had ever heard from an electrical
 device, it produced the sound of an announcer’s voice: “This is amateur
 station W2AG at Yonkers, New York, operating on frequency modulation at
 two and a half meters.”</p>

<p>The audience was hearing something no one had thought possible:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A glass of water was poured before the microphone in Yonkers; it
 sounded like a glass of water being poured. . . . A paper was crumpled
 and torn; it sounded like paper and not like a crackling forest fire. .
 . . Sousa marches were played from records and a piano solo and guitar
 number were performed. . . . The music was projected with a live-ness
 rarely if ever heard before from a radio “music box.”<noteref noteid="note.intro3"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As our own common sense tells us, Armstrong had discovered a vastly
 superior radio technology. But at the time of his invention, Armstrong
 was working for RCA. RCA was the dominant player in the then dominant
 AM radio market. By 1935, there were a thousand radio stations across
 the United States, but the stations in large cities were all owned by a
 handful of networks.</p>

<p>RCA’s president, David Sarnoff, a friend of Armstrong’s, was eager
 that Armstrong discover a way to remove static from AM radio. So
 Sarnoff was quite excited when Armstrong told him he had a device that
 removed static from “radio.” But when Armstrong demonstrated his
 invention, Sarnoff was not pleased.</p>

<p>I thought Armstrong would invent some kind of a filter to remove
 static from our AM radio. I didn’t think he’d start a revolution—start up a whole damn new industry to compete with RCA.<noteref noteid="note.intro4"/></p>

<p>Armstrong’s invention threatened RCA’s AM empire, so the company
 launched a campaign to smother FM radio. While FM may have been a
 superior technology, Sarnoff was a superior tactician. As one author
 described,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The forces for FM, largely engineering, could not overcome the weight
 of strategy devised by the sales, patent, and legal offices to subdue
 this threat to corporate position. For FM, if allowed to develop
 unrestrained, posed . . . a complete reordering of radio power . . .
 and the eventual overthrow of the carefully restricted AM system on
 which RCA had grown to power.<noteref noteid="note.intro5"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further
 tests were needed. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong grew
 impatient, RCA began to use its power with the government to stall FM
 radio’s deployment generally. In 1936, RCA hired the former head of the
 FCC and assigned him the task of assuring that the FCC assign spectrum
 in a way that would castrate FM—principally by moving FM radio to a
 different band of spectrum. At first, these efforts failed. But when
 Armstrong and the nation were distracted by World War II, RCA’s work
 began to be more successful. Soon after the war ended, the FCC
 announced a set of policies that would have one clear effect: FM radio
 would be crippled. As Lawrence Lessing described it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The series of body blows that FM radio received right after the war,
 in a series of rulings manipulated through the FCC by the big radio
 interests, were almost incredible in their force and deviousness.<noteref noteid="note.intro6"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make room in the spectrum for RCA’s latest gamble, television, FM
 radio users were to be moved to a totally new spectrum band. The power
 of FM radio stations was also cut, meaning FM could no longer be used
 to beam programs from one part of the country to another. (This change
 was strongly supported by AT&amp;T, because the loss of FM relaying
 stations would mean radio stations would have to buy wired links from
 AT&amp;T.) The spread of FM radio was thus choked, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Armstrong resisted RCA’s efforts. In response, RCA resisted
 Armstrong’s patents. After incorporating FM technology into the
 emerging standard for television, RCA declared the patents
 invalid—baselessly, and almost fifteen years after they were issued.
 It thus refused to pay him royalties. For six years, Armstrong fought
 an expensive war of litigation to defend the patents. Finally, just as
 the patents expired, RCA offered a settlement so low that it would not
 even cover Armstrong’s lawyers’ fees. Defeated, broken, and now broke,
 in 1954 Armstrong wrote a short note to his wife and then stepped out
 of a thirteenth- story window to his death.</p>
<p>This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically, and
 rarely with heroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it works. From the
 beginning, government and government agencies have been subject to
 capture. They are more likely captured when a powerful interest is
 threatened by either a legal or technical change. That powerful
 interest too often exerts its influence within the government to get
 the government to protect it. The rhetoric of this protection is of
 course always public spirited; the reality is something different.
 Ideas that were as solid as rock in one age, but that, left to
 themselves, would crumble in another, are sustained through this subtle
 corruption of our political process. RCA had what the Causbys did not:
 the power to stifle the effect of technological change.</p>
<p>There’s no single inventor of the Internet. Nor is there any good
 date upon which to mark its birth. Yet in a very short time, the
 Internet has become part of ordinary American life. According to the
 Pew Internet and American Life Project, 58 percent of Americans had
 access to the Internet in 2002, up from 49 percent two years before.<noteref noteid="note.intro7"/> That number could well exceed two thirds of the nation by the
 end of 2004.</p>
<p>As the Internet has been integrated into ordinary life, it has
 changed things. Some of these changes are technical—the Internet has
 made communication faster, it has lowered the cost of gathering data,
 and so on. These technical changes are not the focus of this book. They
 are important. They are not well understood. But they are the sort of
 thing that would simply go away if we all just switched the Internet
 off. They don’t affect people who don’t use the Internet, or at least
 they don’t affect them directly. They are the proper subject of a book
 about the Internet. But this is not a book about the Internet.</p>
<p>Instead, this book is about an effect of the Internet beyond the
 Internet itself: an effect upon how culture is made. My claim is that
 the Internet has induced an important and unrecognized change in that
 process. That change will radically transform a tradition that is as
 old as the Republic itself. Most, if they recognized this change, would
 reject it. Yet most don’t even see the change that the Internet has
 introduced.</p>
<p>We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between
 commercial and noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law’s
 regulation of each. By “commercial culture” I mean that part of our
 culture that is produced and sold or produced to be sold. By
 “noncommercial culture” I mean all the rest. When old men sat around
 parks or on street corners telling stories that kids and others
 consumed, that was noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published
 his “Reader,” or Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our history, and for just about the whole of our
 tradition, noncommercial culture was essentially unregulated. Of
 course, if your stories were lewd, or if your song disturbed the peace,
 then the law might intervene. But the law was never directly concerned
 with the creation or spread of this form of culture, and it left this
 culture “free.” The ordinary ways in which ordinary individuals shared
 and transformed their culture—telling stories, reenacting scenes from
 plays or TV, participating in fan clubs, sharing music, making
 tapes—were left alone by the law.</p>
<p>The focus of the law was on commercial creativity. At first slightly,
 then quite extensively, the law protected the incentives of creators by
 granting them exclusive rights to their creative work, so that they
 could sell those exclusive rights in a commercial marketplace.<noteref noteid="note.intro8"/>
 This is also, of course, an important part of creativity and culture,
 and it has become an increasingly important part in America. But in no
 sense was it dominant within our tradition. It was instead just one
 part, a controlled part, balanced with the free.</p>
<p>This rough divide between the free and the controlled has now been
 erased.<noteref noteid="note.intro9"/> The Internet has set the stage for this erasure
 and, pushed by big media, the law has now affected it. For the first
 time in our tradition, the ordinary ways in which individuals create
 and share culture fall within the reach of the regulation of the law,
 which has expanded to draw within its control a vast amount of culture
 and creativity that it never reached before. The technology that
 preserved the balance of our history—between uses of our culture that
 were free and uses of our culture that were only upon permission—has
 been undone. The consequence is that we are less and less a free
 culture, more and more a permission culture.</p>
<p>This change gets justified as necessary to protect commercial
 creativity. And indeed, protectionism is precisely its motivation. But
 the protectionism that justifies the changes that I will describe below
 is not the limited and balanced sort that has defined the law in the
 past. This is not a protectionism to protect artists. It is instead a
 protectionism to protect certain forms of business. Corporations
 threatened by the potential of the Internet to change the way both
 commercial and noncommercial culture are made and shared have united to
 induce lawmakers to use the law to protect them. It is the story of RCA
 and Armstrong; it is the dream of the Causbys.</p>
<p>For the Internet has unleashed an extraordinary possibility for many
 to participate in the process of building and cultivating a culture
 that reaches far beyond local boundaries. That power has changed the
 marketplace for making and cultivating culture generally, and that
 change in turn threatens established content industries. The Internet
 is thus to the industries that built and distributed content in the
 twentieth century what FM radio was to AM radio, or what the truck was
 to the railroad industry of the nineteenth century: the beginning of
 the end, or at least a substantial transformation. Digital
 technologies, tied to the Internet, could produce a vastly more
 competitive and vibrant market for building and cultivating culture;
 that market could include a much wider and more diverse range of
 creators; those creators could produce and distribute a much more
 vibrant range of creativity; and depending upon a few important
 factors, those creators could earn more on average from this system
 than creators do today—all so long as the RCAs of our day don’t use
 the law to protect themselves against this competition.</p>
<p>Yet, as I argue in the pages that follow, that is precisely what is
 happening in our culture today. These modern-day equivalents of the
 early twentieth-century radio or nineteenth-century railroads are using
 their power to get the law to protect them against this new, more
 efficient, more vibrant technology for building culture. They are
 succeeding in their plan to remake the Internet before the Internet
 remakes them.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem this way to many. The battles over copyright and the
 Internet seem remote to most. To the few who follow them, they seem
 mainly about a much simpler brace of questions—whether “piracy” will
 be permitted, and whether “property” will be protected. The “war” that
 has been waged against the technologies of the Internet—what Motion
 Picture Association of America (MPAA) president Jack Valenti calls his
 “own terrorist war”<noteref noteid="note.intro10"/>—has been framed as a battle about the
 rule of law and respect for property. To know which side to take in
 this war, most think that we need only decide whether we’re for
 property or against it.</p>
<p>If those really were the choices, then I would be with Jack Valenti
 and the content industry. I, too, am a believer in property, and
 especially in the importance of what Mr. Valenti nicely calls “creative
 property.” I believe that “piracy” is wrong, and that the law, properly
 tuned, should punish “piracy,” whether on or off the Internet.</p>
<p>But those simple beliefs mask a much more fundamental question and a
 much more dramatic change. My fear is that unless we come to see this
 change, the war to rid the world of Internet “pirates” will also rid
 our culture of values that have been integral to our tradition from the
 start.</p>
<p>These values built a tradition that, for at least the first 180 years
 of our Republic, guaranteed creators the right to build freely upon
 their past, and protected creators and innovators from either state or
 private control. The First Amendment protected creators against state
 control. And as Professor Neil Netanel powerfully argues,<noteref noteid="note.intro11"/> copyright law, properly balanced, protected creators against private
 control. Our tradition was thus neither Soviet nor the tradition of
 patrons. It instead carved out a wide berth within which creators could
 cultivate and extend our culture.</p>
<p>Yet the law’s response to the Internet, when tied to changes in the
 technology of the Internet itself, has massively increased the
 effective regulation of creativity in America. To build upon or
 critique the culture around us one must ask, Oliver Twist-like, for
 permission first. Permission is, of course, often granted—but it is
 not often granted to the critical or the independent. We have built a
 kind of cultural nobility; those within the noble class live easily;
 those outside it don’t. But it is nobility of any form that is alien to
 our tradition.</p>
<p>The story that follows is about this war. Is it not about the
 “centrality of technology” to ordinary life. I don’t believe in gods,
 digital or otherwise. Nor is it an effort to demonize any individual or
 group, for neither do I believe in a devil, corporate or otherwise. It
 is not a morality tale. Nor is it a call to jihad against an industry.</p>
<p>It is instead an effort to understand a hopelessly destructive war
 inspired by the technologies of the Internet but reaching far beyond
 its code. And by understanding this battle, it is an effort to map
 peace. There is no good reason for the current struggle around Internet
 technologies to continue. There will be great harm to our tradition and
 culture if it is allowed to continue unchecked. We must come to
 understand the source of this war. We must resolve it soon.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Like the Causbys’</b> battle, this war is, in part, about “property.” The property of
 this war is not as tangible as the Causbys’, and no innocent chicken
 has yet to lose its life. Yet the ideas surrounding this “property” are
 as obvious to most as the Causbys’ claim about the sacredness of their
 farm was to them. We are the Causbys. Most of us take for granted the
 extraordinarily powerful claims that the owners of “intellectual
 property” now assert. Most of us, like the Causbys, treat these claims
 as obvious. And hence we, like the Causbys, object when a new
 technology interferes with this property. It is as plain to us as it
 was to them that the new technologies of the Internet are “trespassing” 
 upon legitimate claims of “property.” It is as plain to us as it was to
 them that the law should intervene to stop this trespass.</p>

<p>And thus, when geeks and technologists defend their Armstrong or
 Wright brothers technology, most of us are simply unsympathetic. Common
 sense does not revolt. Unlike in the case of the unlucky Causbys,
 common sense is on the side of the property owners in this war. Unlike
 the lucky Wright brothers, the Internet has not inspired a revolution
 on its side.</p>
<p>My hope is to push this common sense along. I have become
 increasingly amazed by the power of this idea of intellectual property
 and, more importantly, its power to disable critical thought by policy
 makers and citizens. There has never been a time in our history when
 more of our “culture” was as “owned” as it is now. And yet there has
 never been a time when the concentration of power to control the<i>
 uses</i> of culture has been as unquestioningly accepted as it is now.</p>
<p>The puzzle is, Why?</p>
<p>Is it because we have come to understand a truth about the value and
 importance of absolute property over ideas and culture? Is it because
 we have discovered that our tradition of rejecting such an absolute
 claim was wrong?</p>
<p>Or is it because the idea of absolute property over ideas and culture
 benefits the RCAs of our time and fits our own unreflective intuitions?</p>
<p>Is the radical shift away from our tradition of free culture an
 instance of America correcting a mistake from its past, as we did after
 a bloody war with slavery, and as we are slowly doing with inequality?
 Or is the radical shift away from our tradition of free culture yet
 another example of a political system captured by a few powerful
 special interests?</p>
<p>Does common sense lead to the extremes on this question because
 common sense actually believes in these extremes? Or does common sense
 stand silent in the face of these extremes because, as with Armstrong
 versus RCA, the more powerful side has ensured that it has the more
 powerful view?</p>
<p>I don’t mean to be mysterious. My own views are resolved. I believe
 it was right for common sense to revolt against the extremism of the
 Causbys. I believe it would be right for common sense to revolt against
 the extreme claims made today on behalf of “intellectual property.”
 What the law demands today is increasingly as silly as a sheriff
 arresting an airplane for trespass. But the consequences of this
 silliness will be much more profound.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b> The struggle</b> that rages
 just now centers on two ideas: “piracy” and “property.” My aim in this
 book’s next two parts is to explore these two ideas.</p>
<p>My method is not the usual method of an academic. I don’t want to
 plunge you into a complex argument, buttressed with references to
 obscure French theorists—however natural that is for the weird sort we
 academics have become. Instead I begin in each part with a collection
 of stories that set a context within which these apparently simple
 ideas can be more fully understood.</p>
<p>The two sections set up the core claim of this book: that while the
 Internet has indeed produced something fantastic and new, our
 government, pushed by big media to respond to this “something new,” is
 destroying something very old. Rather than understanding the changes
 the Internet might permit, and rather than taking time to let “common
 sense” resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those most
 threatened by the changes to use their power to change the law—and
 more importantly, to use their power to change something fundamental
 about who we have always been.</p>
<p>We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because
 most of us really believe in these changes. We allow it because the
 interests most threatened are among the most powerful players in our
 depressingly compromised process of making law. This book is the story
 of one more consequence of this form of corruption—a consequence to
 which most of us remain oblivious.</p>

<h1 id="piracy">“PIRACY”</h1>

</page-sequence>
<page-sequence>

<p>Since the inception of the law regulating creative property, there has been a war against “piracy.” The precise contours of this concept, “piracy,” are hard to sketch, but the animating injustice is easy to capture. As Lord Mansfield wrote in a case that extended the reach of English copyright law to include sheet music,</p>

<blockquote>
<p> A person may use the copy by playing it, but he has
 no right to rob the author of the profit, by multiplying copies and
 disposing of them for his own use.<noteref noteid="note.piracy1"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today we are in the middle of another “war” against “piracy.” The Internet has provoked this war. The Internet makes possible the efficient spread of content. Peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing is among the most efficient of the efficient technologies the Internet enables. Using distributed intelligence, p2p systems facilitate the easy spread of content in a way unimagined a generation ago.</p>
<p>This efficiency does not respect the traditional lines of copyright. The network doesn’t discriminate between the sharing of copyrighted and uncopyrighted content. Thus has there been a vast amount of sharing of copyrighted content. That sharing in turn has excited the war, as copyright owners fear the sharing will “rob the author of the profit.”</p>
<p>The warriors have turned to the courts, to the legislatures, and increasingly to technology to defend their “property” against this “piracy.” A generation of Americans, the warriors warn, is being raised to believe that “property” should be “free.” Forget tattoos, never mind body piercing—our kids are becoming <i>thieves</i>!</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that “piracy” is wrong, and that pirates should be punished. But before we summon the executioners, we should put this notion of “piracy” in some context. For as the concept is increasingly used, at its core is an extraordinary idea that is almost certainly wrong.</p>
<p>The idea goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creative work has value; whenever I use, or take, or build upon the creative work of others, I am taking from them something of value. Whenever I take something of value from someone else, I should have their permission. The taking of something of value from someone else without permission is wrong. It is a form of piracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This view runs deep within the current debates. It is what NYU law professor Rochelle Dreyfuss criticizes as the “if value, then right” theory of creative property<noteref noteid="note.piracy2"/>—if there is value, then someone must have a right to that value. It is the perspective that led a composers’ rights organization, ASCAP, to sue the Girl Scouts for failing to pay for the songs that girls sang around Girl Scout campfires.<noteref noteid="note.piracy3"/> There was “value” (the songs) so there must have been a “right”—even against the Girl Scouts.</p>
<p>This idea is certainly a possible understanding of how creative property should work. It might well be a possible design for a system of law protecting creative property. But the “if value, then right” theory of creative property has never been America’s theory of creative property. It has never taken hold within our law.</p>
<p>Instead, in our tradition, intellectual property is an instrument. It sets the groundwork for a richly creative society but remains subservient to the value of creativity. The current debate has this turned around. We have become so concerned with protecting the instrument that we are losing sight of the value.</p>
<p>The source of this confusion is a distinction that the law no longer takes care to draw—the distinction between republishing someone’s work on the one hand and building upon or transforming that work on the other. Copyright law at its birth had only publishing as its concern; copyright law today regulates both.</p>
<p>Before the technologies of the Internet, this conflation didn’t matter all that much. The technologies of publishing were expensive; that meant the vast majority of publishing was commercial. Commercial entities could bear the burden of the law—even the burden of the Byzantine complexity that copyright law has become. It was just one more expense of doing business.</p>
<p>But with the birth of the Internet, this natural limit to the reach of the law has disappeared. The law controls not just the creativity of commercial creators but effectively that of anyone. Although that expansion would not matter much if copyright law regulated only “copying,” when the law regulates as broadly and obscurely as it does, the extension matters a lot. The burden of this law now vastly outweighs any original benefit—certainly as it affects noncommercial creativity, and increasingly as it affects commercial creativity as well. Thus, as we’ll see more clearly in the chapters below, the law’s role is less and less to support creativity, and more and more to protect certain industries against competition. Just at the time digital technology could unleash an extraordinary range of commercial and noncommercial creativity, the law burdens this creativity with insanely complex and vague rules and with the threat of obscenely severe penalties. We may be seeing, as Richard Florida writes, the “Rise of the Creative Class.”<noteref noteid="note.piracy4"/> Unfortunately, we are also seeing an extraordinary rise of regulation of this creative class.</p>
<p>These burdens make no sense in our tradition. We should begin by understanding that tradition a bit more and by placing in their proper context the current battles about behavior labeled “piracy.”</p>

<h2 id="ch1">CHAPTER ONE: Creators</h2>

<p><b>In 1928,</b> a cartoon character was born. An early Mickey Mouse
 made his debut in May of that year, in a silent flop called <i>Plane
 Crazy.</i> In November, in New York City’s Colony Theater, in the first
 widely distributed cartoon synchronized with sound, <i>Steamboat Willie</i>
 brought to life the character that would become Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>Synchronized sound had been introduced to film a year earlier in the
 movie <i>The Jazz Singer.</i> That success led Walt Disney to copy the
 technique and mix sound with cartoons. No one knew whether it would
 work or, if it did work, whether it would win an audience. But when
 Disney ran a test in the summer of 1928, the results were unambiguous.
 As Disney describes that first experiment,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A couple of my boys could read music, and one of them
 could play a mouth organ. We put them in a room where they could not
 see the screen and arranged to pipe their sound into the room where our
 wives and friends were going to see the picture.</p>

<p>The boys worked from a music and sound-effects score.
 After several false starts, sound and action got off with the gun. The
 mouth organist played the tune, the rest of us in the sound department
 bammed tin pans and blew slide whistles on the beat. The
 synchronization was pretty close.</p>

<p>The effect on our little audience was nothing less
 than electric. They responded almost instinctively to this union of
 sound and motion. I thought they were kidding me. So they put me in the
 audience and ran the action again. It was terrible, but it was
 wonderful! And it was something new!<noteref noteid="note.chap1.1"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Disney’s then partner, and one of animation’s most extraordinary
 talents, Ub Iwerks, put it more strongly: “I have never been so
 thrilled in my life. Nothing since has ever equaled it.”</p>
<p>Disney had created something very new, based upon something
 relatively new. Synchronized sound brought life to a form of creativity
 that had rarely—except in Disney’s hands—been anything more than
 filler for other films. Throughout animation’s early history, it was
 Disney’s invention that set the standard that others struggled to
 match. And quite often, Disney’s great genius, his spark of creativity,
 was built upon the work of others.</p>
<p>This much is familiar. What you might not know is that 1928 also
 marks another important transition. In that year, a comic (as opposed
 to cartoon) genius created his last independently produced silent film.
 That genius was Buster Keaton. The film was <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</i></p>
<p>Keaton was born into a vaudeville family in 1895. In the era of
 silent film, he had mastered using broad physical comedy as a way to
 spark uncontrollable laughter from his audience. <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</i>
 was a classic of this form, famous among film buffs for its incredible
 stunts. The film was classic Keaton—wildly popular and among the best
 of its genre.</p>

<p><i>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</i> appeared before Disney’s cartoon <i>Steamboat Willie.</i> The
 coincidence of titles is not coincidental. Steamboat Willie is a direct
 cartoon parody of Steamboat Bill,<noteref noteid="note.chap1.2"/> and both are built upon a
 common song as a source. It is not just from the invention of
 synchronized sound in <i>The Jazz Singer</i> that we get <i>Steamboat
 Willie.</i> It is also from Buster Keaton’s invention of Steamboat
 Bill, Jr., itself inspired by the song “Steamboat Bill,” that we get
 Steamboat Willie, and then from Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse.
</p>
<p>This “borrowing” was nothing unique, either for Disney or for the
 industry. Disney was always parroting the feature-length mainstream
 films of his day.<noteref noteid="note.chap1.3"/> So did many others. Early cartoons are
 filled with knockoffs—slight variations on winning themes; retellings
 of ancient stories. The key to success was the brilliance of the
 differences. With Disney, it was sound that gave his animation its
 spark. Later, it was the quality of his work relative to the
 production-line cartoons with which he competed. Yet these additions
 were built upon a base that was borrowed. Disney added to the work of
 others before him, creating something new out of something just barely
 old.</p>
<p>Sometimes this borrowing was slight. Sometimes it was significant.
Think about the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. If you’re as
oblivious as I was, you’re likely to think that these tales are happy,
sweet stories, appropriate for any child at bedtime. In fact, the
Grimm fairy tales are, well, for us, grim. It is a rare and perhaps
overly ambitious parent who would dare to read these bloody,
moralistic stories to his or her child, at bedtime or anytime.</p>
<p>Disney took these stories and retold them in a way that carried them
 into a new age. He animated the stories, with both characters and
 light. Without removing the elements of fear and danger altogether, he
 made funny what was dark and injected a genuine emotion of compassion
 where before there was fear. And not just with the work of the Brothers
 Grimm. Indeed, the catalog of Disney work drawing upon the work of
 others is astonishing when set together: <i>Snow White</i> (1937),<i>
 Fantasia</i> (1940), <i>Pinocchio</i> (1940), <i>Dumbo</i> (1941),<i>
 Bambi</i> (1942), <i>Song of the South</i> (1946), <i>Cinderella</i>
 (1950), <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> (1951), <i>Robin Hood</i> (1952),<i>
 Peter Pan</i> (1953), <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> (1955), <i>Mulan</i>
 (1998), <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> (1959), <i>101 Dalmatians</i> (1961),<i>
 The Sword in the Stone</i> (1963), and <i>The Jungle Book</i>
 (1967)—not to mention a recent example that we should perhaps quickly
 forget, <i>Treasure Planet</i> (2003). In all of these cases, Disney
 (or Disney, Inc.) ripped creativity from the culture around him, mixed
 that creativity with his own extraordinary talent, and then burned that
 mix into the soul of his culture. Rip, mix, and burn.</p>
<p>This is a kind of creativity. It is a creativity that we should
 remember and celebrate. There are some who would say that there is no
 creativity except this kind. We don’t need to go that far to recognize
 its importance. We could call this “Disney creativity,” though that
 would be a bit misleading. It is, more precisely, “Walt Disney
 creativity”—a form of expression and genius that builds upon the
 culture around us and makes it something different.</p>
<p>In 1928, the culture that Disney was free to draw upon was relatively
 fresh. The public domain in 1928 was not very old and was therefore
 quite vibrant. The average term of copyright was just around thirty
 years—for that minority of creative work that was in fact copyrighted.<noteref noteid="note.chap1.4"/> That means that for thirty years, on average, the authors or
 copyright holders of a creative work had an “exclusive right” to
 control certain uses of the work. To use this copyrighted work in
 limited ways required the permission of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>At the end of a copyright term, a work passes into the public domain.
 No permission is then needed to draw upon or use that work. No
 permission and, hence, no lawyers. The public domain is a “lawyer-free
 zone.” Thus, most of the content from the nineteenth century was free
 for Disney to use and build upon in 1928. It was free for anyone—whether connected or not, whether rich or not, whether approved or
 not—to use and build upon.</p>
<p>This is the ways things always were—until quite recently. For most
 of our history, the public domain was just over the horizon. From 1790
 until 1978, the average copyright term was never more than thirty-two
 years, meaning that most culture just a generation and a half old was
 free for anyone to build upon without the permission of anyone else.
 Today’s equivalent would be for creative work from the 1960s and 1970s
 to now be free for the next Walt Disney to build upon without
 permission. Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for
 content from before the Great Depression.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Of course,</b> Walt Disney had no monopoly on “Walt Disney
 creativity.” Nor does America. The norm of free culture has, until
 recently, and except within totalitarian nations, been broadly
 exploited and quite universal.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a form of creativity that seems strange to
 many Americans but that is inescapable within Japanese culture:<i>
 manga,</i> or comics. The Japanese are fanatics about comics. Some 40
 percent of publications are comics, and 30 percent of publication
 revenue derives from comics. They are everywhere in Japanese society,
 at every magazine stand, carried by a large proportion of commuters on
 Japan’s extraordinary system of public transportation.</p>
<p>Americans tend to look down upon this form of culture. That’s an
 unattractive characteristic of ours. We’re likely to misunderstand much
 about manga, because few of us have ever read anything close to the
 stories that these “graphic novels” tell. For the Japanese, manga cover
 every aspect of social life. For us, comics are “men in tights.” And
 anyway, it’s not as if the New York subways are filled with readers of
 Joyce or even Hemingway. People of different cultures distract
 themselves in different ways, the Japanese in this interestingly
 different way.</p>
<p>But my purpose here is not to understand manga. It is to describe a
 variant on manga that from a lawyer’s perspective is quite odd, but
 from a Disney perspective is quite familiar.</p>
<p>This is the phenomenon of <i>doujinshi.</i> Doujinshi are also
 comics, but they are a kind of copycat comic. A rich ethic governs the
 creation of doujinshi. It is not doujinshi if it is <i>just</i> a copy;
 the artist must make a contribution to the art he copies, by
 transforming it either subtly or significantly. A doujinshi comic can
 thus take a mainstream comic and develop it differently—with a
 different story line. Or the comic can keep the character in character
 but change its look slightly. There is no formula for what makes the
 doujinshi sufficiently “different.” But they must be different if they
 are to be considered true doujinshi. Indeed, there are committees that
 review doujinshi for inclusion within shows and reject any copycat
 comic that is merely a copy.</p>
<p>These copycat comics are not a tiny part of the manga market. They
 are huge. More than 33,000 “circles” of creators from across Japan
 produce these bits of Walt Disney creativity. More than 450,000
 Japanese come together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in
 the country, to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel
 to the mainstream commercial manga market. In some ways, it obviously
 competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort by those
 who control the commercial manga market to shut the doujinshi market
 down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law.</p>
<p>The most puzzling feature of the doujinshi market, for those trained
 in the law, at least, is that it is allowed to exist at all. Under
 Japanese copyright law, which in this respect (on paper) mirrors
 American copyright law, the doujinshi market is an illegal one.
 Doujinshi are plainly “derivative works.” There is no general practice
 by doujinshi artists of securing the permission of the manga creators.
 Instead, the practice is simply to take and modify the creations of
 others, as Walt Disney did with <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr.</i> Under both
 Japanese and American law, that “taking” without the permission of the
 original copyright owner is illegal. It is an infringement of the
 original copyright to make a copy or a derivative work without the
 original copyright owner’s permission.</p>
<p>Yet this illegal market exists and indeed flourishes in Japan, and in
 the view of many, it is precisely because it exists that Japanese manga
 flourish. As American graphic novelist Judd Winick said to me, “The
 early days of comics in America are very much like what’s going on in
 Japan now. . . . American comics were born out of copying each other. .
 . . That’s how [the artists] learn to draw—by going into comic books
 and not tracing them, but looking at them and copying them” and
 building from them.<noteref noteid="note.chap1.5"/></p>
<p>American comics now are quite different, Winick explains, in part
 because of the legal difficulty of adapting comics the way doujinshi
 are allowed. Speaking of Superman, Winick told me, “there are these
 rules and you have to stick to them.” There are things Superman
 “cannot” do. “As a creator, it’s frustrating having to stick to some
 parameters which are fifty years old.”</p>
<p>The norm in Japan mitigates this legal difficulty. Some say it is
 precisely the benefit accruing to the Japanese manga market that
 explains the mitigation. Temple University law professor Salil Mehra,
 for example, hypothesizes that the manga market accepts these technical
 violations because they spur the manga market to be more wealthy and
 productive. Everyone would be worse off if doujinshi were banned, so
 the law does not ban doujinshi.<noteref noteid="note.chap1.6"/></p>
<p>The problem with this story, however, as Mehra plainly acknowledges,
 is that the mechanism producing this laissez faire response is not
 clear. It may well be that the market as a whole is better off if
 doujinshi are permitted rather than banned, but that doesn’t explain
 why individual copyright owners don’t sue nonetheless. If the law has
 no general exception for doujinshi, and indeed in some cases individual
 manga artists have sued doujinshi artists, why is there not a more
 general pattern of blocking this “free taking” by the doujinshi
 culture?</p>
<p>I spent four wonderful months in Japan, and I asked this question as
 often as I could. Perhaps the best account in the end was offered by a
 friend from a major Japanese law firm. “We don’t have enough lawyers,”
 he told me one afternoon. There “just aren’t enough resources to
 prosecute cases like this.”</p>
<p>This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a
 function of both the words on the books and the costs of making those
 words have effect. For now, focus on the obvious question that is
 begged: Would Japan be better off with more lawyers? Would manga be
 richer if doujinshi artists were regularly prosecuted? Would the
 Japanese gain something important if they could end this practice of
 uncompensated sharing? Does piracy here hurt the victims of the piracy,
 or does it help them? Would lawyers fighting this piracy help their
 clients or hurt them?</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Let’s pause</b> for a moment.</p>
<p>If you’re like I was a decade ago, or like most people are when they
 first start thinking about these issues, then just about now you should
 be puzzled about something you hadn’t thought through before.</p>
<p>We live in a world that celebrates “property.” I am one of those
 celebrants. I believe in the value of property in general, and I also
 believe in the value of that weird form of property that lawyers call
 “intellectual property.”<noteref noteid="note.chap1.7"/> A large, diverse society cannot
 survive without property; a large, diverse, and modern society cannot
 flourish without intellectual property.</p>
<p>But it takes just a second’s reflection to realize that there is
 plenty of value out there that “property” doesn’t capture. I don’t mean
 “money can’t buy you love,” but rather, value that is plainly part of a
 process of production, including commercial as well as noncommercial
 production. If Disney animators had stolen a set of pencils to draw
 Steamboat Willie, we’d have no hesitation in condemning that taking as
 wrong— even though trivial, even if unnoticed. Yet there was nothing
 wrong, at least under the law of the day, with Disney’s taking from
 Buster Keaton or from the Brothers Grimm. There was nothing wrong with
 the taking from Keaton because Disney’s use would have been considered
 “fair.” There was nothing wrong with the taking from the Grimms because
 the Grimms’ work was in the public domain.</p>
<p>Thus, even though the things that Disney took—or more generally, the
 things taken by anyone exercising Walt Disney creativity—are valuable,
 our tradition does not treat those takings as wrong. Some things remain
 free for the taking within a free culture, and that freedom is good.</p>
<p>The same with the doujinshi culture. If a doujinshi artist broke into
 a publisher’s office and ran off with a thousand copies of his latest
 work—or even one copy—without paying, we’d have no hesitation in
 saying the artist was wrong. In addition to having trespassed, he would
 have stolen something of value. The law bans that stealing in whatever
 form, whether large or small.</p>
<p>Yet there is an obvious reluctance, even among Japanese lawyers, to
 say that the copycat comic artists are “stealing.” This form of Walt
 Disney creativity is seen as fair and right, even if lawyers in
 particular find it hard to say why.</p>
<p>It’s the same with a thousand examples that appear everywhere once
 you begin to look. Scientists build upon the work of other scientists
 without asking or paying for the privilege. (“Excuse me, Professor
 Einstein, but may I have permission to use your theory of relativity to
 show that you were wrong about quantum physics?”) Acting companies
 perform adaptations of the works of Shakespeare without securing
 permission from anyone. (Does <i>anyone</i> believe Shakespeare would
 be better spread within our culture if there were a central Shakespeare
 rights clearinghouse that all productions of Shakespeare must appeal to
 first?) And Hollywood goes through cycles with a certain kind of movie:
 five asteroid films in the late 1990s; two volcano disaster films in
 1997.</p>
<p>Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building
 upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now. That
 building is always and everywhere at least partially done without
 permission and without compensating the original creator. No society,
 free or controlled, has ever demanded that every use be paid for or
 that permission for Walt Disney creativity must always be sought.
 Instead, every society has left a certain bit of its culture free for
 the taking—free societies more fully than unfree, perhaps, but all
 societies to some degree.</p>
<p>The hard question is therefore not <i>whether</i> a culture is free.
 All cultures are free to some degree. The hard question instead is “<i>
How</i> free is this culture?” How much, and how broadly, is the culture
 free for others to take and build upon? Is that freedom limited to
 party members? To members of the royal family? To the top ten
 corporations on the New York Stock Exchange? Or is that freedom spread
 broadly? To artists generally, whether affiliated with the Met or not?
 To musicians generally, whether white or not? To filmmakers generally,
 whether affiliated with a studio or not?</p>
<p>Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to
 build upon; unfree, or permission, cultures leave much less. Ours was a
 free culture. It is becoming much less so.</p>

<h2 id="ch2">CHAPTER TWO: “Mere Copyists”</h2>

<p><b>In 1839,</b> Louis Daguerre invented the first practical
 technology for producing what we would call “photographs.”
 Appropriately enough, they were called “daguerreotypes.” The process
 was complicated and expensive, and the field was thus limited to
 professionals and a few zealous and wealthy amateurs. (There was even
 an American Daguerre Association that helped regulate the industry, as
 do all such associations, by keeping competition down so as to keep
 prices up.)</p>
<p>Yet despite high prices, the demand for daguerreotypes was strong.
 This pushed inventors to find simpler and cheaper ways to make
 “automatic pictures.” William Talbot soon discovered a process for
 making “negatives.” But because the negatives were glass, and had to be
 kept wet, the process still remained expensive and cumbersome. In the
 1870s, dry plates were developed, making it easier to separate the
 taking of a picture from its developing. These were still plates of
 glass, and thus it was still not a process within reach of most
 amateurs.</p>
<p>The technological change that made mass photography possible didn’t
 happen until 1888, and was the creation of a single man. George
 Eastman, himself an amateur photographer, was frustrated by the
 technology of photographs made with plates. In a flash of insight (so
 to speak), Eastman saw that if the film could be made to be flexible,
 it could be held on a single spindle. That roll could then be sent to a
 developer, driving the costs of photography down substantially. By
 lowering the costs, Eastman expected he could dramatically broaden the
 population of photographers.</p>
<p>Eastman developed flexible, emulsion-coated paper film and placed
 rolls of it in small, simple cameras: the Kodak. The device was
 marketed on the basis of its simplicity. “You press the button and we
 do the rest.”<noteref noteid="note.chap2.1"/> As he described in <i>The Kodak Primer</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The principle of the Kodak system is the separation of the work that
 any person whomsoever can do in making a photograph, from the work that
 only an expert can do. . . . We furnish anybody, man, woman or child,
 who has sufficient intelligence to point a box straight and press a
 button, with an instrument which altogether removes from the practice
 of photography the necessity for exceptional facilities or, in fact,
 any special knowledge of the art. It can be employed without
 preliminary study, without a darkroom and without chemicals.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.2"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For $25, anyone could make pictures. The camera came preloaded with
 film, and when it had been used, the camera was returned to an Eastman
 factory, where the film was developed. Over time, of course, the cost
 of the camera and the ease with which it could be used both improved.
 Roll film thus became the basis for the explosive growth of popular
 photography. Eastman’s camera first went on sale in 1888; one year
 later, Kodak was printing more than six thousand negatives a day. From
 1888 through 1909, while industrial production was rising by 4.7
 percent, photographic equipment and material sales increased by 11
 percent.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.3"/> Eastman Kodak’s sales during the same period
 experienced an average annual increase of over 17 percent.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.4"/></p>
<p>The real significance of Eastman’s invention, however, was not
 economic. It was social. Professional photography gave individuals a
 glimpse of places they would never otherwise see. Amateur photography
 gave them the ability to record their own lives in a way they had never
 been able to do before. As author Brian Coe notes, “For the first time
 the snapshot album provided the man on the street with a permanent
 record of his family and its activities. . . . For the first time in
 history there exists an authentic visual record of the appearance and
 activities of the common man made without [literary] interpretation or
 bias.”<noteref noteid="note.chap2.5"/></p>
<p>In this way, the Kodak camera and film were technologies of
 expression. The pencil or paintbrush was also a technology of
 expression, of course. But it took years of training before they could
 be deployed by amateurs in any useful or effective way. With the Kodak,
 expression was possible much sooner and more simply. The barrier to
 expression was lowered. Snobs would sneer at its “quality”;
 professionals would discount it as irrelevant. But watch a child study
 how best to frame a picture and you get a sense of the experience of
 creativity that the Kodak enabled. Democratic tools gave ordinary
 people a way to express themselves more easily than any tools could
 have before.</p>
<p>What was required for this technology to flourish? Obviously,
 Eastman’s genius was an important part. But also important was the
 legal environment within which Eastman’s invention grew. For early in
 the history of photography, there was a series of judicial decisions
 that could well have changed the course of photography substantially.
 Courts were asked whether the photographer, amateur or professional,
 required permission before he could capture and print whatever image he
 wanted. Their answer was no.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.6"/></p>
<p>The arguments in favor of requiring permission will sound
 surprisingly familiar. The photographer was “taking” something from the
 person or building whose photograph he shot—pirating something of
 value. Some even thought he was taking the target’s soul. Just as
 Disney was not free to take the pencils that his animators used to draw
 Mickey, so, too, should these photographers not be free to take images
 that they thought valuable.</p>
<p>On the other side was an argument that should be familiar, as well.
 Sure, there may be something of value being used. But citizens should
 have the right to capture at least those images that stand in public
 view. (Louis Brandeis, who would become a Supreme Court Justice,
 thought the rule should be different for images from private spaces.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.7"/>) It may be that this means that the photographer gets something
 for nothing. Just as Disney could take inspiration from <i>Steamboat
 Bill, Jr.</i> or the Brothers Grimm, the photographer should be free to
 capture an image without compensating the source.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Mr. Eastman, and for photography in general, these
 early decisions went in favor of the pirates. In general, no permission
 would be required before an image could be captured and shared with
 others. Instead, permission was presumed. Freedom was the default. (The
 law would eventually craft an exception for famous people: commercial
 photographers who snap pictures of famous people for commercial
 purposes have more restrictions than the rest of us. But in the
 ordinary case, the image can be captured without clearing the rights to
 do the capturing.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.8"/>)</p>
<p>We can only speculate about how photography would have developed had
 the law gone the other way. If the presumption had been against the
 photographer, then the photographer would have had to demonstrate
 permission. Perhaps Eastman Kodak would have had to demonstrate
 permission, too, before it developed the film upon which images were
 captured. After all, if permission were not granted, then Eastman Kodak
 would be benefiting from the “theft” committed by the photographer.
 Just as Napster benefited from the copyright infringements committed by
 Napster users, Kodak would be benefiting from the “image-right” 
 infringement of its photographers. We could imagine the law then
 requiring that some form of permission be demonstrated before a company
 developed pictures. We could imagine a system developing to demonstrate
 that permission.</p>
<p>But though we could imagine this system of permission, it would be
 very hard to see how photography could have flourished as it did if the
 requirement for permission had been built into the rules that govern
 it. Photography would have existed. It would have grown in importance
 over time. Professionals would have continued to use the technology as
 they did—since professionals could have more easily borne the burdens
 of the permission system. But the spread of photography to ordinary
 people would not have occurred. Nothing like that growth would have
 been realized. And certainly, nothing like that growth in a democratic
 technology of expression would have been realized.</p>

<p><b>If you drive</b> through San Francisco’s Presidio, you might see
 two gaudy yellow school buses painted over with colorful and striking
 images, and the logo “Just Think!” in place of the name of a school.
 But there’s little that’s “just” cerebral in the projects that these
 busses enable. These buses are filled with technologies that teach kids
 to tinker with film. Not the film of Eastman. Not even the film of your
 VCR. Rather the “film” of digital cameras. Just Think! is a project
 that enables kids to make films, as a way to understand and critique
 the filmed culture that they find all around them. Each year, these
 busses travel to more than thirty schools and enable three hundred to
 five hundred children to learn something about media by doing something
 with media. By doing, they think. By tinkering, they learn.</p>
<p>These buses are not cheap, but the technology they carry is
 increasingly so. The cost of a high-quality digital video system has
 fallen dramatically. As one analyst puts it, “Five years ago, a good
 real-time digital video editing system cost $25,000. Today you can get
 professional quality for $595.”<noteref noteid="note.chap2.9"/> These buses are filled with
 technology that would have cost hundreds of thousands just ten years
 ago. And it is now feasible to imagine not just buses like this, but
 classrooms across the country where kids are learning more and more of
 something teachers call “media literacy.”</p>
<p>“Media literacy,” as Dave Yanofsky, the executive director of Just
 Think!, puts it, “is the ability . . . to understand, analyze, and
 deconstruct media images. Its aim is to make [kids] literate about the
 way media works, the way it’s constructed, the way it’s delivered, and
 the way people access it.”</p>
<p>This may seem like an odd way to think about “literacy.” For most
 people, literacy is about reading and writing. Faulkner and Hemingway
 and noticing split infinitives are the things that “literate” people
 know about.</p>
<p>Maybe. But in a world where children see on average 390 hours of
 television commercials per year, or between 20,000 and 45,000
 commercials generally,<noteref noteid="note.chap2.10"/> it is increasingly important to
 understand the “grammar” of media. For just as there is a grammar for
 the written word, so, too, is there one for media. And just as kids
 learn how to write by writing lots of terrible prose, kids learn how to
 write media by constructing lots of (at least at first) terrible media.</p>
<p>A growing field of academics and activists sees this form of literacy
 as crucial to the next generation of culture. For though anyone who has
 written understands how difficult writing is—how difficult it is to
 sequence the story, to keep a reader’s attention, to craft language to
 be understandable—few of us have any real sense of how difficult media
 is. Or more fundamentally, few of us have a sense of how media works,
 how it holds an audience or leads it through a story, how it triggers
 emotion or builds suspense.</p>
<p>It took filmmaking a generation before it could do these things well.
 But even then, the knowledge was in the filming, not in writing about
 the film. The skill came from experiencing the making of a film, not
 from reading a book about it. One learns to write by writing and then
 reflecting upon what one has written. One learns to write with images
 by making them and then reflecting upon what one has created.</p>
<p>This grammar has changed as media has changed. When it was just film,
 as Elizabeth Daley, executive director of the University of Southern
 California’s Annenberg Center for Communication and dean of the USC
 School of Cinema-Television, explained to me, the grammar was about
 “the placement of objects, color, . . . rhythm, pacing, and texture.”<noteref noteid="note.chap2.11"/> But as computers open up an interactive space where a story is
 “played” as well as experienced, that grammar changes. The simple
 control of narrative is lost, and so other techniques are necessary.
 Author Michael Crichton had mastered the narrative of science fiction.
 But when he tried to design a computer game based on one of his works,
 it was a new craft he had to learn. How to lead people through a game
 without their feeling they have been led was not obvious, even to a
 wildly successful author.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.12"/></p>
<p>This skill is precisely the craft a filmmaker learns. As Daley
 describes, “people are very surprised about how they are led through a
 film. [I]t is perfectly constructed to keep you from seeing it, so you
 have no idea. If a filmmaker succeeds you do not know how you were
 led.” If you know you were led through a film, the film has failed.</p>
<p>Yet the push for an expanded literacy—one that goes beyond text to
 include audio and visual elements—is not about making better film
 directors. The aim is not to improve the profession of filmmaking at
 all. Instead, as Daley explained,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From my perspective, probably the most important
 digital divide is not access to a box. It’s the ability to be empowered
 with the language that that box works in. Otherwise only a very few
 people can write with this language, and all the rest of us are reduced
 to being read-only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Read-only.” Passive recipients of culture produced elsewhere. Couch
 potatoes. Consumers. This is the world of media from the twentieth
 century.</p>
<p>The twenty-first century could be different. This is the crucial
 point: It could be both read and write. Or at least reading and better
 understanding the craft of writing. Or best, reading and understanding
 the tools that enable the writing to lead or mislead. The aim of any
 literacy, and this literacy in particular, is to “empower people to
 choose the appropriate language for what they need to create or
 express.”<noteref noteid="note.chap2.13"/> It is to enable students “to communicate in the
 language of the twenty-first century.”<noteref noteid="note.chap2.14"/></p>
<p>As with any language, this language comes more easily to some than to
 others. It doesn’t necessarily come more easily to those who excel in
 written language. Daley and Stephanie Barish, director of the Institute
 for Multimedia Literacy at the Annenberg Center, describe one
 particularly poignant example of a project they ran in a high school.
 The high school was a very poor inner-city Los Angeles school. In all
 the traditional measures of success, this school was a failure. But
 Daley and Barish ran a program that gave kids an opportunity to use
 film to express meaning about something the students know something
 about—gun violence.</p>
<p>The class was held on Friday afternoons, and it created a relatively
 new problem for the school. While the challenge in most classes was
 getting the kids to come, the challenge in this class was keeping them
 away. The “kids were showing up at 6 A.M. and leaving at 5 at night,”
 said Barish. They were working harder than in any other class to do
 what education should be about—learning how to express themselves.</p>
<p>Using whatever “free web stuff they could find,” and relatively
 simple tools to enable the kids to mix “image, sound, and text,” Barish
 said this class produced a series of projects that showed something
 about gun violence that few would otherwise understand. This was an
 issue close to the lives of these students. The project “gave them a
 tool and empowered them to be able to both understand it and talk about
 it,” Barish explained. That tool succeeded in creating expression—far
 more successfully and powerfully than could have been created using
 only text. “If you had said to these students, ’you have to do it in
 text,’ they would’ve just thrown their hands up and gone and done
 something else,” Barish described, in part, no doubt, because
 expressing themselves in text is not something these students can do
 well. Yet neither is text a form in which <i>these</i> ideas can be
 expressed well. The power of this message depended upon its connection
 to this form of expression.</p>
<p>“But isn’t education about teaching kids to write?” I asked. In part,
 of course, it is. But why are we teaching kids to write? Education,
 Daley explained, is about giving students a way of “constructing
 meaning.” To say that that means just writing is like saying teaching
 writing is only about teaching kids how to spell. Text is one part—and
 increasingly, not the most powerful part—of constructing meaning. As
 Daley explained in the most moving part of our interview,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What you want is to give these students ways of
 constructing meaning. If all you give them is text, they’re not going
 to do it. Because they can’t. You know, you’ve got Johnny who can look
 at a video, he can play a video game, he can do graffiti all over your
 walls, he can take your car apart, and he can do all sorts of other
 things. He just can’t read your text. So Johnny comes to school and you
 say, “Johnny, you’re illiterate. Nothing you can do matters.” Well,
 Johnny then has two choices: He can dismiss you or he [can] dismiss
 himself. If his ego is healthy at all, he’s going to dismiss you. [But
 i]nstead, if you say, “Well, with all these things that you can do,
 let’s talk about this issue. Play for me music that you think reflects
 that, or show me images that you think reflect that, or draw for me
 something that reflects that.” Not by giving a kid a video camera and .
 . . saying,”Let’s go have fun with the video camera and make a little
 movie.” But instead, really help you take these elements that you
 understand, that are your language, and construct meaning about the
 topic. . . .</p>

<p>That empowers enormously. And then what happens, of
 course, is eventually, as it has happened in all these classes, they
 bump up against the fact, “I need to explain this and I really need to
 write something.” And as one of the teachers told Stephanie, they would
 rewrite a paragraph 5, 6, 7, 8 times, till they got it right.</p>

<p>Because they needed to. There was a reason for doing
 it. They needed to say something, as opposed to just jumping through
 your hoops. They actually needed to use a language that they didn’t
 speak very well. But they had come to understand that they had a lot of
 power with this language.”</p>
</blockquote>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>When two planes</b> crashed into the World Trade Center, another
 into the Pentagon, and a fourth into a Pennsylvania field, all media
 around the world shifted to this news. Every moment of just about every
 day for that week, and for weeks after, television in particular, and
 media generally, retold the story of the events we had just witnessed.
 The telling was a retelling, because we had seen the events that were
 described. The genius of this awful act of terrorism was that the
 delayed second attack was perfectly timed to assure that the whole
 world would be watching.</p>
<p>These retellings had an increasingly familiar feel. There was music
 scored for the intermissions, and fancy graphics that flashed across
 the screen. There was a formula to interviews. There was “balance,” and
 seriousness. This was news choreographed in the way we have
 increasingly come to expect it, “news as entertainment,” even if the
 entertainment is tragedy.</p>
<p>But in addition to this produced news about the “tragedy of September
 11,” those of us tied to the Internet came to see a very different
 production as well. The Internet was filled with accounts of the same
 events. Yet these Internet accounts had a very different flavor. Some
 people constructed photo pages that captured images from around the
 world and presented them as slide shows with text. Some offered open
 letters. There were sound recordings. There was anger and frustration.
 There were attempts to provide context. There was, in short, an
 extraordinary worldwide barn raising, in the sense Mike Godwin uses the
 term in his book <i>Cyber Rights,</i> around a news event that had
 captured the attention of the world. There was ABC and CBS, but there
 was also the Internet.</p>
<p>I don’t mean simply to praise the Internet—though I do think the
 people who supported this form of speech should be praised. I mean
 instead to point to a significance in this form of speech. For like a
 Kodak, the Internet enables people to capture images. And like in a
 movie by a student on the “Just Think!” bus, the visual images could be
 mixed with sound or text.</p>
<p>But unlike any technology for simply capturing images, the Internet
 allows these creations to be shared with an extraordinary number of
 people, practically instantaneously. This is something new in our
 tradition—not just that culture can be captured mechanically, and
 obviously not just that events are commented upon critically, but that
 this mix of captured images, sound, and commentary can be widely spread
 practically instantaneously.</p>
<p>September 11 was not an aberration. It was a beginning. Around the
 same time, a form of communication that has grown dramatically was just
 beginning to come into public consciousness: the Web-log, or blog. The
 blog is a kind of public diary, and within some cultures, such as in
 Japan, it functions very much like a diary. In those cultures, it
 records private facts in a public way—it’s a kind of electronic<i>
 Jerry Springer,</i> available anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But in the United States, blogs have taken on a very different
 character. There are some who use the space simply to talk about their
 private life. But there are many who use the space to engage in public
 discourse. Discussing matters of public import, criticizing others who
 are mistaken in their views, criticizing politicians about the
 decisions they make, offering solutions to problems we all see: blogs
 create the sense of a virtual public meeting, but one in which we don’t
 all hope to be there at the same time and in which conversations are
 not necessarily linked. The best of the blog entries are relatively
 short; they point directly to words used by others, criticizing with or
 adding to them. They are arguably the most important form of
 unchoreographed public discourse that we have.</p>
<p>That’s a strong statement. Yet it says as much about our democracy as
 it does about blogs. This is the part of America that is most difficult
 for those of us who love America to accept: Our democracy has
 atrophied. Of course we have elections, and most of the time the courts
 allow those elections to count. A relatively small number of people
 vote in those elections. The cycle of these elections has become
 totally professionalized and routinized. Most of us think this is
 democracy.</p>
<p>But democracy has never just been about elections. Democracy means
 rule by the people, but rule means something more than mere elections.
 In our tradition, it also means control through reasoned discourse.
 This was the idea that captured the imagination of Alexis de
 Tocqueville, the nineteenth-century French lawyer who wrote the most
 important account of early “Democracy in America.” It wasn’t popular
 elections that fascinated him—it was the jury, an institution that
 gave ordinary people the right to choose life or death for other
 citizens. And most fascinating for him was that the jury didn’t just
 vote about the outcome they would impose. They deliberated. Members
 argued about the “right” result; they tried to persuade each other of
 the “right” result, and in criminal cases at least, they had to agree
 upon a unanimous result for the process to come to an end.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.15"/></p>
<p>Yet even this institution flags in American life today. And in its
 place, there is no systematic effort to enable citizen deliberation.
 Some are pushing to create just such an institution.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.16"/> And
 in some towns in New England, something close to deliberation remains.
 But for most of us for most of the time, there is no time or place for
 “democratic deliberation” to occur.</p>
<p>More bizarrely, there is generally not even permission for it to
 occur. We, the most powerful democracy in the world, have developed a
 strong norm against talking about politics. It’s fine to talk about
 politics with people you agree with. But it is rude to argue about
 politics with people you disagree with. Political discourse becomes
 isolated, and isolated discourse becomes more extreme.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.17"/> We
 say what our friends want to hear, and hear very little beyond what our
 friends say.</p>
<p>Enter the blog. The blog’s very architecture solves one part of this
 problem. People post when they want to post, and people read when they
 want to read. The most difficult time is synchronous time. Technologies
 that enable asynchronous communication, such as e-mail, increase the
 opportunity for communication. Blogs allow for public discourse without
 the public ever needing to gather in a single public place.</p>
<p>But beyond architecture, blogs also have solved the problem of norms.
 There’s no norm (yet) in blog space not to talk about politics. Indeed,
 the space is filled with political speech, on both the right and the
 left. Some of the most popular sites are conservative or libertarian,
 but there are many of all political stripes. And even blogs that are
 not political cover political issues when the occasion merits.</p>
<p>The significance of these blogs is tiny now, though not so tiny. The
 name Howard Dean may well have faded from the 2004 presidential race
 but for blogs. Yet even if the number of readers is small, the reading
 is having an effect.</p>
<p>One direct effect is on stories that had a different life cycle in
 the mainstream media. The Trent Lott affair is an example. When Lott
 “misspoke” at a party for Senator Strom Thurmond, essentially praising
 Thurmond’s segregationist policies, he calculated correctly that this
 story would disappear from the mainstream press within forty-eight
 hours. It did. But he didn’t calculate its life cycle in blog space.
 The bloggers kept researching the story. Over time, more and more
 instances of the same “misspeaking” emerged. Finally, the story broke
 back into the mainstream press. In the end, Lott was forced to resign
 as senate majority leader.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.18"/></p>
<p>This different cycle is possible because the same commercial
 pressures don’t exist with blogs as with other ventures. Television and
 newspapers are commercial entities. They must work to keep attention.
 If they lose readers, they lose revenue. Like sharks, they must move
 on.</p>
<p>But bloggers don’t have a similar constraint. They can obsess, they
 can focus, they can get serious. If a particular blogger writes a
 particularly interesting story, more and more people link to that
 story. And as the number of links to a particular story increases, it
 rises in the ranks of stories. People read what is popular; what is
 popular has been selected by a very democratic process of
 peer-generated rankings.</p>
<p>There’s a second way, as well, in which blogs have a different cycle
 from the mainstream press. As Dave Winer, one of the fathers of this
 movement and a software author for many decades, told me, another
 difference is the absence of a financial “conflict of interest.”</p>
<p>“I think you have to take the conflict of interest” out of
 journalism, Winer told me. “An amateur journalist simply doesn’t have a
 conflict of interest, or the conflict of interest is so easily
 disclosed that you know you can sort of get it out of the way.”</p>
<p>These conflicts become more important as media becomes more
 concentrated (more on this below). A concentrated media can hide more
 from the public than an unconcentrated media can—as CNN admitted it
 did after the Iraq war because it was afraid of the consequences to its
 own employees.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.19"/> It also needs to sustain a more coherent
 account. (In the middle of the Iraq war, I read a post on the Internet
 from someone who was at that time listening to a satellite uplink with
 a reporter in Iraq. The New York headquarters was telling the reporter
 over and over that her account of the war was too bleak: She needed to
 offer a more optimistic story. When she told New York that wasn’t
 warranted, they told her that <i>they</i> were writing “the story.”)</p>
<p>Blog space gives amateurs a way to enter the debate—“amateur” not in
 the sense of inexperienced, but in the sense of an Olympic athlete,
 meaning not paid by anyone to give their reports. It allows for a much
 broader range of input into a story, as reporting on the Columbia
 disaster revealed, when hundreds from across the southwest United
 States turned to the Internet to retell what they had seen.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.20"/>
 And it drives readers to read across the range of accounts and
 “triangulate,” as Winer puts it, the truth. Blogs, Winer says, are
 “communicating directly with our constituency, and the middle man is
 out of it”—with all the benefits, and costs, that might entail.</p>
<p>Winer is optimistic about the future of journalism infected with
 blogs. “It’s going to become an essential skill,” Winer predicts, for
 public figures and increasingly for private figures as well. It’s not
 clear that “journalism” is happy about this—some journalists have been
 told to curtail their blogging.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.21"/> But it is clear that we
 are still in transition. “A lot of what we are doing now is warm-up
 exercises,” Winer told me. There is a lot that must mature before this
 space has its mature effect. And as the inclusion of content in this
 space is the least infringing use of the Internet (meaning infringing
 on copyright), Winer said, “we will be the last thing that gets shut
 down.”</p>
<p>This speech affects democracy. Winer thinks that happens because “you
 don’t have to work for somebody who controls, [for] a gate-keeper.”
 That is true. But it affects democracy in another way as well. As more
 and more citizens express what they think, and defend it in writing,
 that will change the way people understand public issues. It is easy to
 be wrong and misguided in your head. It is harder when the product of
 your mind can be criticized by others. Of course, it is a rare human
 who admits that he has been persuaded that he is wrong. But it is even
 rarer for a human to ignore when he has been proven wrong. The writing
 of ideas, arguments, and criticism improves democracy. Today there are
 probably a couple of million blogs where such writing happens. When
 there are ten million, there will be something extraordinary to report.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>John Seely Brown</b> is the chief scientist of the Xerox
 Corporation. His work, as his Web site describes it, is “human learning
 and . . . the creation of knowledge ecologies for creating . . .
 innovation.”</p>
<p>Brown thus looks at these technologies of digital creativity a bit
 differently from the perspectives I’ve sketched so far. I’m sure he
 would be excited about any technology that might improve democracy. But
 his real excitement comes from how these technologies affect learning.</p>
<p>As Brown believes, we learn by tinkering. When “a lot of us grew up,”
 he explains, that tinkering was done “on motorcycle engines, lawn-mower engines, automobiles, radios, and so on.” But digital
 technologies enable a different kind of tinkering—with abstract ideas
 though in concrete form. The kids at Just Think! not only think about
 how a commercial portrays a politician; using digital technology, they
 can take the commercial apart and manipulate it, tinker with it to see
 how it does what it does. Digital technologies launch a kind of
 bricolage, or “free collage,” as Brown calls it. Many get to add to or
 transform the tinkering of many others.</p>
<p>The best large-scale example of this kind of tinkering so far is free
 software or open-source software (FS/OSS). FS/OSS is software whose
 source code is shared. Anyone can download the technology that makes a
 FS/OSS program run. And anyone eager to learn how a particular bit of
 FS/OSS technology works can tinker with the code.</p>
<p>This opportunity creates a “completely new kind of learning
 platform,” as Brown describes. “As soon as you start doing that, you .
 . . unleash a free collage on the community, so that other people can
 start looking at your code, tinkering with it, trying it out, seeing if
 they can improve it.” Each effort is a kind of apprenticeship. “Open
 source becomes a major apprenticeship platform.”</p>
<p>In this process, “the concrete things you tinker with are abstract.
 They are code.” Kids are “shifting to the ability to tinker in the
 abstract, and this tinkering is no longer an isolated activity that
 you’re doing in your garage. You are tinkering with a community
 platform. . . .</p>
<p>You are tinkering with other people’s stuff. The more you tinker the
 more you improve.” The more you improve, the more you learn.</p>
<p>This same thing happens with content, too. And it happens in the same
 collaborative way when that content is part of the Web. As Brown puts
 it, “the Web [is] the first medium that truly honors multiple forms of
 intelligence.” Earlier technologies, such as the typewriter or word
 processors, helped amplify text. But the Web amplifies much more than
 text. “The Web . . . says if you are musical, if you are artistic, if
 you are visual, if you are interested in film . . . [then] there is a
 lot you can start to do on this medium. [It] can now amplify and honor
 these multiple forms of intelligence.”</p>
<p>Brown is talking about what Elizabeth Daley, Stephanie Barish, and
 Just Think! teach: that this tinkering with culture teaches as well as
 creates. It develops talents differently, and it builds a different
 kind of recognition.</p>
<p>Yet the freedom to tinker with these objects is not guaranteed.
 Indeed, as we’ll see through the course of this book, that freedom is
 increasingly highly contested. While there’s no doubt that your father
 had the right to tinker with the car engine, there’s great doubt that
 your child will have the right to tinker with the images she finds all
 around. The law and, increasingly, technology interfere with a freedom
 that technology, and curiosity, would otherwise ensure.</p>
<p>These restrictions have become the focus of researchers and scholars.
 Professor Ed Felten of Princeton (whom we’ll see more of in chapter 10)
 has developed a powerful argument in favor of the “right to tinker” as
 it applies to computer science and to knowledge in general.<noteref noteid="note.chap2.22"/>
 But Brown’s concern is earlier, or younger, or more fundamental. It is
 about the learning that kids can do, or can’t do, because of the law.</p>
<p>“This is where education in the twenty-first century is going,” Brown
 explains. We need to “understand how kids who grow up digital think and
 want to learn.”</p>
<p>“Yet,” as Brown continued, and as the balance of this book will
 evince, “we are building a legal system that completely suppresses the
 natural tendencies of today’s digital kids. . . . We’re building an
 architecture that unleashes 60 percent of the brain [and] a legal
 system that closes down that part of the brain.”</p>
<p>We’re building a technology that takes the magic of Kodak, mixes
 moving images and sound, and adds a space for commentary and an
 opportunity to spread that creativity everywhere. But we’re building
 the law to close down that technology.</p>
<p>“No way to run a culture,” as Brewster Kahle, whom we’ll meet in
 chapter 9, quipped to me in a rare moment of despondence.</p>

<h2 id="ch3">CHAPTER THREE: Catalogs</h2>

<p>In the fall of 2002, Jesse Jordan of Oceanside, New York, enrolled as
 a freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York. His
 major at RPI was information technology. Though he is not a programmer,
 in October Jesse decided to begin to tinker with search engine
 technology that was available on the RPI network.</p>
<p>RPI is one of America’s foremost technological research institutions.
 It offers degrees in fields ranging from architecture and engineering
 to information sciences. More than 65 percent of its five thousand
 undergraduates finished in the top 10 percent of their high school
 class. The school is thus a perfect mix of talent and experience to
 imagine and then build, a generation for the network age.</p>
<p>RPI’s computer network links students, faculty, and administration to
 one another. It also links RPI to the Internet. Not everything
 available on the RPI network is available on the Internet. But the
 network is designed to enable students to get access to the Internet,
 as well as more intimate access to other members of the RPI community.</p>
<p>Search engines are a measure of a network’s intimacy. Google brought
 the Internet much closer to all of us by fantastically improving the
 quality of search on the network. Specialty search engines can do this
 even better. The idea of “intranet” search engines, search engines that
 search within the network of a particular institution, is to provide
 users of that institution with better access to material from that
 institution. Businesses do this all the time, enabling employees to
 have access to material that people outside the business can’t get.
 Universities do it as well.</p>
<p>These engines are enabled by the network technology itself.
 Microsoft, for example, has a network file system that makes it very
 easy for search engines tuned to that network to query the system for
 information about the publicly (within that network) available content.</p>
<p>Jesse’s search engine was built to take advantage of this technology.
 It used Microsoft’s network file system to build an index of all the
 files available within the RPI network.</p>
<p>Jesse’s wasn’t the first search engine built for the RPI network.
 Indeed, his engine was a simple modification of engines that others had
 built. His single most important improvement over those engines was to
 fix a bug within the Microsoft file-sharing system that could cause a
 user’s computer to crash. With the engines that existed before, if you
 tried to access a file through a Windows browser that was on a computer
 that was off-line, your computer could crash. Jesse modified the system
 a bit to fix that problem, by adding a button that a user could click
 to see if the machine holding the file was still on-line.</p>
<p>Jesse’s engine went on-line in late October. Over the following six
 months, he continued to tweak it to improve its functionality. By
 March, the system was functioning quite well. Jesse had more than one
 million files in his directory, including every type of content that
 might be on users’ computers.</p>
<p>Thus the index his search engine produced included pictures, which
 students could use to put on their own Web sites; copies of notes or
 research; copies of information pamphlets; movie clips that students
 might have created; university brochures—basically anything that users
 of the RPI network made available in a public folder of their computer.</p>
<p>But the index also included music files. In fact, one quarter of the
 files that Jesse’s search engine listed were music files. But that
 means, of course, that three quarters were not, and—so that this point
 is absolutely clear—Jesse did nothing to induce people to put music
 files in their public folders. He did nothing to target the search
 engine to these files. He was a kid tinkering with a Google-like
 technology at a university where he was studying information science,
 and hence, tinkering was the aim. Unlike Google, or Microsoft, for that
 matter, he made no money from this tinkering; he was not connected to
 any business that would make any money from this experiment. He was a
 kid tinkering with technology in an environment where tinkering with
 technology was precisely what he was supposed to do.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2003, Jesse was contacted by the dean of students at RPI.
 The dean informed Jesse that the Recording Industry Association of
 America, the RIAA, would be filing a lawsuit against him and three
 other students whom he didn’t even know, two of them at other
 universities. A few hours later, Jesse was served with papers from the
 suit. As he read these papers and watched the news reports about them,
 he was increasingly astonished.</p>
<p>“It was absurd,” he told me. “I don’t think I did anything wrong. . .
 .</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the search engine that I
 ran or . . . what I had done to it. I mean, I hadn’t modified it in any
 way that promoted or enhanced the work of pirates. I just modified the
 search engine in a way that would make it easier to use”—again, a<i>
 search engine,</i> which Jesse had not himself built, using the Windows
 file-sharing system, which Jesse had not himself built, to enable
 members of the RPI community to get access to content, which Jesse had
 not himself created or posted, and the vast majority of which had
 nothing to do with music.</p>
<p>But the RIAA branded Jesse a pirate. They claimed he operated a
 network and had therefore “willfully” violated copyright laws. They
 demanded that he pay them the damages for his wrong. For cases of
 “willful infringement,” the Copyright Act specifies something lawyers
 call “statutory damages.” These damages permit a copyright owner to
 claim $150,000 per infringement. As the RIAA alleged more than one
 hundred specific copyright infringements, they therefore demanded that
 Jesse pay them at least $15,000,000.</p>
<p>Similar lawsuits were brought against three other students: one other
 student at RPI, one at Michigan Technical University, and one at
 Princeton. Their situations were similar to Jesse’s. Though each case
 was different in detail, the bottom line in each was exactly the same:
 huge demands for “damages” that the RIAA claimed it was entitled to. If
 you added up the claims, these four lawsuits were asking courts in the
 United States to award the plaintiffs close to $100 <i>billion</i>—six
 times the <i>total</i> profit of the film industry in 2001.<noteref noteid="note.chap3.1"/></p>
<p>Jesse called his parents. They were supportive but a bit frightened.
 An uncle was a lawyer. He began negotiations with the RIAA. They
 demanded to know how much money Jesse had. Jesse had saved $12,000 from
 summer jobs and other employment. They demanded $12,000 to dismiss the
 case.</p>
<p>The RIAA wanted Jesse to admit to doing something wrong. He refused.
 They wanted him to agree to an injunction that would essentially make
 it impossible for him to work in many fields of technology for the rest
 of his life. He refused. They made him understand that this process of
 being sued was not going to be pleasant. (As Jesse’s father recounted
 to me, the chief lawyer on the case, Matt Oppenheimer, told Jesse, “You
 don’t want to pay another visit to a dentist like me.”) And throughout,
 the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took every
 penny Jesse had saved.</p>
<p>Jesse’s family was outraged at these claims. They wanted to fight.
 But Jesse’s uncle worked to educate the family about the nature of the
 American legal system. Jesse could fight the RIAA. He might even win.
 But the cost of fighting a lawsuit like this, Jesse was told, would be
 at least $250,000. If he won, he would not recover that money. If he
 won, he would have a piece of paper saying he had won, and a piece of
 paper saying he and his family were bankrupt.</p>
<p>So Jesse faced a mafia-like choice: $250,000 and a chance at winning,
 or $12,000 and a settlement.</p>
<p>The recording industry insists this is a matter of law and morality.</p>
<p>Let’s put the law aside for a moment and think about the morality.
 Where is the morality in a lawsuit like this? What is the virtue in
 scapegoatism? The RIAA is an extraordinarily powerful lobby. The
 president of the RIAA is reported to make more than $1 million a year.
 Artists, on the other hand, are not well paid. The average recording
 artist makes $45,900.<noteref noteid="note.chap3.2"/> There are plenty of ways for the RIAA
 to affect and direct policy. So where is the morality in taking money
 from a student for running a search engine?<noteref noteid="note.chap3.3"/></p>
<p>On June 23, Jesse wired his savings to the lawyer working for the
 RIAA. The case against him was then dismissed. And with this, this kid
 who had tinkered a computer into a $15 million lawsuit became an
 activist:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was definitely not an activist [before]. I never really meant to be
 an activist. . . . [But] I’ve been pushed into this. In no way did I
 ever foresee anything like this, but I think it’s just completely
 absurd what the RIAA has done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesse’s parents betray a certain pride in their reluctant activist.
 As his father told me, Jesse “considers himself very conservative, and
 so do I. . . . He’s not a tree hugger. . . . I think it’s bizarre that
 they would pick on him. But he wants to let people know that they’re
 sending the wrong message. And he wants to correct the record.”</p>

<h2 id="ch4">CHAPTER FOUR: “Pirates”</h2>

<p><b>If</b> “<b>piracy” means</b> using the creative property of others
 without their permission—if “if value, then right” is true—then the
 history of the content industry is a history of piracy. Every important
 sector of “big media” today—film, records, radio, and cable TV—was
 born of a kind of piracy so defined. The consistent story is how last
 generation’s pirates join this generation’s country club—until now.</p>

<h2 id='ch4.1'>Film</h2>

<p>The film industry of Hollywood was built by fleeing pirates.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.1"/>
 Creators and directors migrated from the East Coast to California in
 the early twentieth century in part to escape controls that patents
 granted the inventor of filmmaking, Thomas Edison. These controls were
 exercised through a monopoly “trust,” the Motion Pictures Patents
 Company, and were based on Thomas Edison’s creative property—patents.
 Edison formed the MPPC to exercise the rights this creative property
 gave him, and the MPPC was serious about the control it demanded. As
 one commentator tells one part of the story,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A January 1909 deadline was set for all companies to
 comply with the license. By February, unlicensed outlaws, who referred
 to themselves as independents protested the trust and carried on
 business without submitting to the Edison monopoly. In the summer of
 1909 the independent movement was in full-swing, with producers and
 theater owners using illegal equipment and imported film stock to
 create their own underground market.</p>

<p>With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion
 in the number of nickelodeons, the Patents Company reacted to the
 independent movement by forming a strong-arm subsidiary known as the
 General Film Company to block the entry of non-licensed independents.
 With coercive tactics that have become legendary, General Film
 confiscated unlicensed equipment, discontinued product supply to
 theaters which showed unlicensed films, and effectively monopolized
 distribution with the acquisition of all U.S. film exchanges, except
 for the one owned by the independent William Fox who defied the Trust
 even after his license was revoked.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.2"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Napsters of those days, the “independents,” were companies like
 Fox. And no less than today, these independents were vigorously
 resisted. “Shooting was disrupted by machinery stolen, and ’accidents’
 resulting in loss of negatives, equipment, buildings and sometimes life
 and limb frequently occurred.”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.3"/> That led the independents to
 flee the East Coast. California was remote enough from Edison’s reach
 that film-makers there could pirate his inventions without fear of the
 law. And the leaders of Hollywood filmmaking, Fox most prominently, did
 just that.</p>
<p>Of course, California grew quickly, and the effective enforcement of
 federal law eventually spread west. But because patents grant the
 patent holder a truly “limited” monopoly (just seventeen years at that
 time), by the time enough federal marshals appeared, the patents had
 expired. A new industry had been born, in part from the piracy of
 Edison’s creative property.</p>

<h2 id='ch4.2'>Recorded Music</h2>

<p>The record industry was born of another kind of piracy, though to see
 how requires a bit of detail about the way the law regulates music.</p>
<p>At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines for
 reproducing music (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player piano),
 the law gave composers the exclusive right to control copies of their
 music and the exclusive right to control public performances of their
 music. In other words, in 1900, if I wanted a copy of Phil Russel’s
 1899 hit “Happy Mose,” the law said I would have to pay for the right
 to get a copy of the musical score, and I would also have to pay for
 the right to perform it publicly.</p>
<p>But what if I wanted to record “Happy Mose,” using Edison’s
 phonograph or Fourneaux’s player piano? Here the law stumbled. It was
 clear enough that I would have to buy any copy of the musical score
 that I performed in making this recording. And it was clear enough that
 I would have to pay for any public performance of the work I was
 recording. But it wasn’t totally clear that I would have to pay for a
 “public performance” if I recorded the song in my own house (even
 today, you don’t owe the Beatles anything if you sing their songs in
 the shower), or if I recorded the song from memory (copies in your
 brain are not—yet—regulated by copyright law). So if I simply sang
 the song into a recording device in the privacy of my own home, it
 wasn’t clear that I owed the composer anything. And more importantly,
 it wasn’t clear whether I owed the composer anything if I then made
 copies of those recordings. Because of this gap in the law, then, I
 could effectively pirate someone else’s song without paying its
 composer anything.</p>
<p>The composers (and publishers) were none too happy about this
 capacity to pirate. As South Dakota senator Alfred Kittredge put it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or an
 opera. A publisher buys at great expense the rights to the same and
 copyrights it. Along come the phonographic companies and companies who
 cut music rolls and deliberately steal the work of the brain of the
 composer and publisher without any regard for [their] rights.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.4"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The innovators who developed the technology to record other people’s
 works were “sponging upon the toil, the work, the talent, and genius of
 American composers,”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.5"/> and the “music publishing industry” 
 was thereby “at the complete mercy of this one pirate.”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.6"/> As
 John Philip Sousa put it, in as direct a way as possible, “When they
 make money out of my pieces, I want a share of it.”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.7"/></p>
<p>These arguments have familiar echoes in the wars of our day. So, too,
 do the arguments on the other side. The innovators who developed the
 player piano argued that “it is perfectly demonstrable that the
 introduction of automatic music players has not deprived any composer
 of anything he had before their introduction.” Rather, the machines
 increased the sales of sheet music.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.8"/> In any case, the
 innovators argued, the job of Congress was “to consider first the
 interest of [the public], whom they represent, and whose servants they
 are.”</p>
<p>“All talk about ’theft,’“ the general counsel of the American
 Graphophone Company wrote, “is the merest claptrap, for there exists no
 property in ideas musical, literary or artistic, except as defined by
 statute.”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.9"/></p>
<p>The law soon resolved this battle in favor of the composer <i>and</i>
 the recording artist. Congress amended the law to make sure that
 composers would be paid for the “mechanical reproductions” of their
 music. But rather than simply granting the composer complete control
 over the right to make mechanical reproductions, Congress gave
 recording artists a right to record the music, at a price set by
 Congress, once the composer allowed it to be recorded once. This is the
 part of copyright law that makes cover songs possible. Once a composer
 authorizes a recording of his song, others are free to record the same
 song, so long as they pay the original composer a fee set by the law.</p>
<p>American law ordinarily calls this a “compulsory license,” but I will
 refer to it as a “statutory license.” A statutory license is a license
 whose key terms are set by law. After Congress’s amendment of the
 Copyright Act in 1909, record companies were free to distribute copies
 of recordings so long as they paid the composer (or copyright holder)
 the fee set by the statute.</p>
<p>This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John Grisham
 writes a novel, a publisher is free to publish that novel only if
 Grisham gives the publisher permission. Grisham, in turn, is free to
 charge whatever he wants for that permission. The price to publish
 Grisham is thus set by Grisham, and copyright law ordinarily says you
 have no permission to use Grisham’s work except with permission of
 Grisham.</p>
<p>But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less. And
 thus, in effect, the law <i>subsidizes</i> the recording industry
 through a kind of piracy—by giving recording artists a weaker right
 than it otherwise gives creative authors. The Beatles have less control
 over their creative work than Grisham does. And the beneficiaries of
 this less control are the recording industry and the public. The
 recording industry gets something of value for less than it otherwise
 would pay; the public gets access to a much wider range of musical
 creativity. Indeed, Congress was quite explicit about its reasons for
 granting this right. Its fear was the monopoly power of rights holders,
 and that that power would stifle follow-on creativity.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.10"/></p>
<p>While the recording industry has been quite coy about this recently,
 historically it has been quite a supporter of the statutory license for
 records. As a 1967 report from the House Committee on the Judiciary
 relates,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the record producers argued vigorously that the
 compulsory license system must be retained. They asserted that the
 record industry is a half-billion-dollar business of great economic
 importance in the United States and throughout the world; records today
 are the principal means of disseminating music, and this creates
 special problems, since performers need unhampered access to musical
 material on nondiscriminatory terms. Historically, the record producers
 pointed out, there were no recording rights before 1909 and the 1909
 statute adopted the compulsory license as a deliberate anti-monopoly
 condition on the grant of these rights. They argue that the result has
 been an outpouring of recorded music, with the public being given lower
 prices, improved quality, and a greater choice.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.11"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By limiting the rights musicians have, by partially pirating their
 creative work, the record producers, and the public, benefit.</p>


<h2 id='ch4.3'>Radio</h2>

<p>Radio was also born of piracy.</p>
<p>When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes a
 “public performance” of the composer’s work.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.12"/> As I
 described above, the law gives the composer (or copyright holder) an
 exclusive right to public performances of his work. The radio station
 thus owes the composer money for that performance.</p>
<p>But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only performing
 a copy of the <i>composer’s</i> work. The radio station is also
 performing a copy of the <i>recording artist’s</i> work. It’s one thing
 to have “Happy Birthday” sung on the radio by the local children’s
 choir; it’s quite another to have it sung by the Rolling Stones or Lyle
 Lovett. The recording artist is adding to the value of the composition
 performed on the radio station. And if the law were perfectly
 consistent, the radio station would have to pay the recording artist
 for his work, just as it pays the composer of the music for his work.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t. Under the law governing radio performances, the radio
 station does not have to pay the recording artist. The radio station
 need only pay the composer. The radio station thus gets a bit of
 something for nothing. It gets to perform the recording artist’s work
 for free, even if it must pay the composer something for the privilege
 of playing the song.</p>
<p>This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of music.
 Imagine it is your first. You own the exclusive right to authorize
 public performances of that music. So if Madonna wants to sing your
 song in public, she has to get your permission.</p>
<p>Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot. She
 then decides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a top
 hit. Under our law, every time a radio station plays your song, you get
 some money. But Madonna gets nothing, save the indirect effect on the
 sale of her CDs. The public performance of her recording is not a
 “protected” right. The radio station thus gets to <i>pirate</i> the
 value of Madonna’s work without paying her anything.</p>
<p>No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording artists
 benefit. On average, the promotion they get is worth more than the
 performance rights they give up. Maybe. But even if so, the law
 ordinarily gives the creator the right to make this choice. By making
 the choice for him or her, the law gives the radio station the right to
 take something for nothing.</p>


<h2 id='ch4.4'>Cable TV</h2>

<p>Cable TV was also born of a kind of piracy.</p>
<p>When cable entrepreneurs first started wiring communities with cable
 television in 1948, most refused to pay broadcasters for the content
 that they echoed to their customers. Even when the cable companies
 started selling access to television broadcasts, they refused to pay
 for what they sold. Cable companies were thus Napsterizing
 broadcasters’ content, but more egregiously than anything Napster ever
 did—Napster never charged for the content it enabled others to give
 away.</p>
<p>Broadcasters and copyright owners were quick to attack this theft.
 Rosel Hyde, chairman of the FCC, viewed the practice as a kind of
 “unfair and potentially destructive competition.”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.13"/> There
 may have been a “public interest” in spreading the reach of cable TV,
 but as Douglas Anello, general counsel to the National Association of
 Broadcasters, asked Senator Quentin Burdick during testimony, “Does
 public interest dictate that you use somebody else’s property?”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.14"/>
 As another broadcaster put it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary thing about the CATV business is
 that it is the only business I know of where the product that is being
 sold is not paid for.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.15"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the demand of the copyright holders seemed reasonable enough:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All we are asking for is a very simple thing, that people who now
 take our property for nothing pay for it. We are trying to stop piracy
 and I don’t think there is any lesser word to describe it. I think
 there are harsher words which would fit it.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.16"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were “free-ride[rs],” Screen Actor’s Guild president Charlton
 Heston said, who were “depriving actors of compensation.”<noteref noteid="note.chap4.17"/></p>
<p>But again, there was another side to the debate. As Assistant
 Attorney General Edwin Zimmerman put it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our point here is that unlike the problem of whether you have any
 copyright protection at all, the problem here is whether copyright
 holders who are already compensated, who already have a monopoly,
 should be permitted to extend that monopoly. . . . The question here is
 how much compensation they should have and how far back they should
 carry their right to compensation.<noteref noteid="note.chap4.18"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copyright owners took the cable companies to court. Twice the Supreme
 Court held that the cable companies owed the copyright owners nothing.</p>
<p>It took Congress almost thirty years before it resolved the question
 of whether cable companies had to pay for the content they “pirated.”
 In the end, Congress resolved this question in the same way that it
 resolved the question about record players and player pianos. Yes,
 cable companies would have to pay for the content that they broadcast;
 but the price they would have to pay was not set by the copyright
 owner. The price was set by law, so that the broadcasters couldn’t
 exercise veto power over the emerging technologies of cable. Cable
 companies thus built their empire in part upon a “piracy” of the value
 created by broadcasters’ content.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>These separate stories</b> sing a common theme. If “piracy” means
 using value from someone else’s creative property without permission
 from that creator—as it is increasingly described today<noteref noteid="note.chap4.19"/>—then <i>every</i> industry affected by copyright today is the product
 and beneficiary of a certain kind of piracy. Film, records, radio,
 cable TV. . . . The list is long and could well be expanded. Every
 generation welcomes the pirates from the last. Every generation—until
 now.</p>

<h2 id="ch5">CHAPTER FIVE: “Piracy”</h2>

<p><b>There is piracy</b> of copyrighted material. Lots of it. This
 piracy comes in many forms. The most significant is commercial piracy,
 the unauthorized taking of other people’s content within a commercial
 context. Despite the many justifications that are offered in its
 defense, this taking is wrong. No one should condone it, and the law
 should stop it.</p>
<p>But as well as copy-shop piracy, there is another kind of “taking” 
 that is more directly related to the Internet. That taking, too, seems
 wrong to many, and it is wrong much of the time. Before we paint this
 taking “piracy,” however, we should understand its nature a bit more.
 For the harm of this taking is significantly more ambiguous than
 outright copying, and the law should account for that ambiguity, as it
 has so often done in the past.</p>

<h2 id='ch5.1'>Piracy I</h2>

<p>All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe,
 there are businesses that do nothing but take others people’s
 copyrighted content, copy it, and sell it—all without the permission
 of a copyright owner. The recording industry estimates that it loses
 about $4.6 billion every year to physical piracy<noteref noteid="note.chap5.1"/> (that
 works out to one in three CDs sold worldwide). The MPAA estimates that
 it loses $3 billion annually worldwide to piracy.</p>
<p>This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this
 book, nor in the argument that most people make when talking about the
 subject of this book, should draw into doubt this simple point: This
 piracy is wrong.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that excuses and justifications couldn’t be made
 for it. We could, for example, remind ourselves that for the first one
 hundred years of the American Republic, America did not honor foreign
 copyrights. We were born, in this sense, a pirate nation. It might
 therefore seem hypocritical for us to insist so strongly that other
 developing nations treat as wrong what we, for the first hundred years
 of our existence, treated as right.</p>
<p>That excuse isn’t terribly strong. Technically, our law did not ban
 the taking of foreign works. It explicitly limited itself to American
 works. Thus the American publishers who published foreign works without
 the permission of foreign authors were not violating any rule. The copy
 shops in Asia, by contrast, are violating Asian law. Asian law does
 protect foreign copyrights, and the actions of the copy shops violate
 that law. So the wrong of piracy that they engage in is not just a
 moral wrong, but a legal wrong, and not just an internationally legal
 wrong, but a locally legal wrong as well.</p>
<p>True, these local rules have, in effect, been imposed upon these
 countries. No country can be part of the world economy and choose not
 to protect copyright internationally. We may have been born a pirate
 nation, but we will not allow any other nation to have a similar
 childhood.</p>
<p>If a country is to be treated as a sovereign, however, then its laws
 are its laws regardless of their source. The international law under
 which these nations live gives them some opportunities to escape the
 burden of intellectual property law.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.2"/> In my view, more
 developing nations should take advantage of that opportunity, but when
 they don’t, then their laws should be respected. And under the laws of
 these nations, this piracy is wrong.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could try to excuse this piracy by noting that in
 any case, it does no harm to the industry. The Chinese who get access
 to American CDs at 50 cents a copy are not people who would have bought
 those American CDs at $15 a copy. So no one really has any less money
 than they otherwise would have had.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.3"/></p>
<p>This is often true (though I have friends who have purchased many
 thousands of pirated DVDs who certainly have enough money to pay for
 the content they have taken), and it does mitigate to some degree the
 harm caused by such taking. Extremists in this debate love to say, “You
 wouldn’t go into Barnes &amp; Noble and take a book off of the shelf
 without paying; why should it be any different with on-line music?” The
 difference is, of course, that when you take a book from Barnes &amp;
 Noble, it has one less book to sell. By contrast, when you take an MP3
 from a computer network, there is not one less CD that can be sold. The
 physics of piracy of the intangible are different from the physics of
 piracy of the tangible.</p>
<p>This argument is still very weak. However, although copyright is a
 property right of a very special sort, it <i>is</i> a property right.
 Like all property rights, the copyright gives the owner the right to
 decide the terms under which content is shared. If the copyright owner
 doesn’t want to sell, she doesn’t have to. There are exceptions:
 important statutory licenses that apply to copyrighted content
 regardless of the wish of the copyright owner. Those licenses give
 people the right to “take” copyrighted content whether or not the
 copyright owner wants to sell. But where the law does not give people
 the right to take content, it is wrong to take that content even if the
 wrong does no harm. If we have a property system, and that system is
 properly balanced to the technology of a time, then it is wrong to take
 property without the permission of a property owner. That is exactly
 what “property” means.</p>
<p>Finally, we could try to excuse this piracy with the argument that
 the piracy actually helps the copyright owner. When the Chinese “steal” 
 Windows, that makes the Chinese dependent on Microsoft. Microsoft loses
 the value of the software that was taken. But it gains users who are
 used to life in the Microsoft world. Over time, as the nation grows
 more wealthy, more and more people will buy software rather than steal
 it. And hence over time, because that buying will benefit Microsoft,
 Microsoft benefits from the piracy. If instead of pirating Microsoft
 Windows, the Chinese used the free GNU/Linux operating system, then
 these Chinese users would not eventually be buying Microsoft. Without
 piracy, then, Microsoft would lose.</p>
<p>This argument, too, is somewhat true. The addiction strategy is a
 good one. Many businesses practice it. Some thrive because of it. Law
 students, for example, are given free access to the two largest legal
 databases. The companies marketing both hope the students will become
 so used to their service that they will want to use it and not the
 other when they become lawyers (and must pay high subscription fees).</p>
<p>Still, the argument is not terribly persuasive. We don’t give the
 alcoholic a defense when he steals his first beer, merely because that
 will make it more likely that he will buy the next three. Instead, we
 ordinarily allow businesses to decide for themselves when it is best to
 give their product away. If Microsoft fears the competition of
 GNU/Linux, then Microsoft can give its product away, as it did, for
 example, with Internet Explorer to fight Netscape. A property right
 means giving the property owner the right to say who gets access to
 what—at least ordinarily. And if the law properly balances the rights
 of the copyright owner with the rights of access, then violating the
 law is still wrong.</p>
<p>Thus, while I understand the pull of these justifications for piracy,
 and I certainly see the motivation, in my view, in the end, these
 efforts at justifying commercial piracy simply don’t cut it. This kind
 of piracy is rampant and just plain wrong. It doesn’t transform the
 content it steals; it doesn’t transform the market it competes in. It
 merely gives someone access to something that the law says he should
 not have. Nothing has changed to draw that law into doubt. This form of
 piracy is flat out wrong.</p>
<p>But as the examples from the four chapters that introduced this part
 suggest, even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all “piracy” is. Or
 at least, not all “piracy” is wrong if that term is understood in the
 way it is increasingly used today. Many kinds of “piracy” are useful
 and productive, to produce either new content or new ways of doing
 business. Neither our tradition nor any tradition has ever banned all
 “piracy” in that sense of the term.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that there are no questions raised by the latest
 piracy concern, peer-to-peer file sharing. But it does mean that we
 need to understand the harm in peer-to-peer sharing a bit more before
 we condemn it to the gallows with the charge of piracy.</p>
<p>For (1) like the original Hollywood, p2p sharing escapes an overly
 controlling industry; and (2) like the original recording industry, it
 simply exploits a new way to distribute content; but (3) unlike cable
 TV, no one is selling the content that is shared on p2p services.</p>
<p>These differences distinguish p2p sharing from true piracy. They
 should push us to find a way to protect artists while enabling this
 sharing to survive.</p>

<h2 id='ch5.2'>Piracy II</h2>

<p>The key to the “piracy” that the law aims to quash is a use that
 “rob[s] the author of [his] profit.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.4"/> This means we must
 determine whether and how much p2p sharing harms before we know how
 strongly the law should seek to either prevent it or find an
 alternative to assure the author of his profit.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer sharing was made famous by Napster. But the inventors of
 the Napster technology had not made any major technological
 innovations. Like every great advance in innovation on the Internet
 (and, arguably, off the Internet as well<noteref noteid="note.chap5.5"/>), Shawn Fanning
 and crew had simply put together components that had been developed
 independently.</p>
<p>The result was spontaneous combustion. Launched in July 1999, Napster
 amassed over 10 million users within nine months. After eighteen
 months, there were close to 80 million registered users of the system.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.6"/> Courts quickly shut Napster down, but other services emerged to
 take its place. (Kazaa is currently the most popular p2p service. It
 boasts over 100 million members.) These services’ systems are different
 architecturally, though not very different in function: Each enables
 users to make content available to any number of other users. With a
 p2p system, you can share your favorite songs with your best friend—or your 20,000 best friends.</p>
<p>According to a number of estimates, a huge proportion of Americans
 have tasted file-sharing technology. A study by Ipsos-Insight in
 September 2002 estimated that 60 million Americans had downloaded
 music—28 percent of Americans older than 12.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.7"/> A survey by
 the NPD group quoted in <i>The New York Times</i> estimated that 43
 million citizens used file-sharing networks to exchange content in May
 2003.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.8"/> The vast majority of these are not kids. Whatever the
 actual figure, a massive quantity of content is being “taken” on these
 networks. The ease and inexpensiveness of file-sharing networks have
 inspired millions to enjoy music in a way that they hadn’t before.</p>
<p>Some of this enjoying involves copyright infringement. Some of it
 does not. And even among the part that is technically copyright
 infringement, calculating the actual harm to copyright owners is more
 complicated than one might think. So consider—a bit more carefully
 than the polarized voices around this debate usually do—the kinds of
 sharing that file sharing enables, and the kinds of harm it entails.</p>
<p>File sharers share different kinds of content. We can divide these
 different kinds into four types.</p>
<p>A. There are some who use sharing networks as substitutes for
 purchasing content. Thus, when a new Madonna CD is released, rather
 than buying the CD, these users simply take it. We might quibble about
 whether everyone who takes it would actually have bought it if sharing
 didn’t make it available for free. Most probably wouldn’t have, but
 clearly there are some who would. The latter are the target of category
 A: users who download instead of purchasing.</p>
<p>B. There are some who use sharing networks to sample music before
 purchasing it. Thus, a friend sends another friend an MP3 of an artist
 he’s not heard of. The other friend then buys CDs by that artist. This
 is a kind of targeted advertising, quite likely to succeed. If the
 friend recommending the album gains nothing from a bad recommendation,
 then one could expect that the recommendations will actually be quite
 good. The net effect of this sharing could increase the quantity of
 music purchased.</p>
<p>C. There are many who use sharing networks to get access to
 copyrighted content that is no longer sold or that they would not have
 purchased because the transaction costs off the Net are too high. This
 use of sharing networks is among the most rewarding for many. Songs
 that were part of your childhood but have long vanished from the
 marketplace magically appear again on the network. (One friend told me
 that when she discovered Napster, she spent a solid weekend “recalling” 
 old songs. She was astonished at the range and mix of content that was
 available.) For content not sold, this is still technically a violation
 of copyright, though because the copyright owner is not selling the
 content anymore, the economic harm is zero—the same harm that occurs
 when I sell my collection of 1960s 45-rpm records to a local collector.</p>
<p>D. Finally, there are many who use sharing networks to get access to
 content that is not copyrighted or that the copyright owner wants to
 give away.</p>
<p>How do these different types of sharing balance out? Let’s start with
 some simple but important points. From the perspective of the law, only
 type D sharing is clearly legal. From the perspective of economics,
 only type A sharing is clearly harmful.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.9"/> Type B sharing is
 illegal but plainly beneficial. Type C sharing is illegal, yet good for
 society (since more exposure to music is good) and harmless to the
 artist (since the work is not otherwise available). So how sharing
 matters on balance is a hard question to answer—and certainly much
 more difficult than the current rhetoric around the issue suggests.</p>
<p>Whether on balance sharing is harmful depends importantly on how
 harmful type A sharing is. Just as Edison complained about Hollywood,
 composers complained about piano rolls, recording artists complained
 about radio, and broadcasters complained about cable TV, the music
 industry complains that type A sharing is a kind of “theft” that is
 “devastating” the industry.</p>
<p>While the numbers do suggest that sharing is harmful, how harmful is
 harder to reckon. It has long been the recording industry’s practice to
 blame technology for any drop in sales. The history of cassette
 recording is a good example. As a study by Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young put
 it, “Rather than exploiting this new, popular technology, the labels
 fought it.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.10"/> The labels claimed that every album taped was
 an album unsold, and when record sales fell by 11.4 percent in 1981,
 the industry claimed that its point was proved. Technology was the
 problem, and banning or regulating technology was the answer.</p>
<p>Yet soon thereafter, and before Congress was given an opportunity to
 enact regulation, MTV was launched, and the industry had a record
 turnaround. “In the end,” Cap Gemini concludes, “the ’crisis’ . . . was
 not the fault of the tapers—who did not [stop after MTV came into
 being]—but had to a large extent resulted from stagnation in musical
 innovation at the major labels.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.11"/></p>
<p>But just because the industry was wrong before does not mean it is
 wrong today. To evaluate the real threat that p2p sharing presents to
 the industry in particular, and society in general—or at least the
 society that inherits the tradition that gave us the film industry, the
 record industry, the radio industry, cable TV, and the VCR—the
 question is not simply whether type A sharing is harmful. The question
 is also <i>how</i> harmful type A sharing is, and how beneficial the
 other types of sharing are.</p>
<p>We start to answer this question by focusing on the net harm, from
 the standpoint of the industry as a whole, that sharing networks cause.
 The “net harm” to the industry as a whole is the amount by which type A
 sharing exceeds type B. If the record companies sold more records
 through sampling than they lost through substitution, then sharing
 networks would actually benefit music companies on balance. They would
 therefore have little <i>static</i> reason to resist them.</p>
<p>Could that be true? Could the industry as a whole be gaining because
 of file sharing? Odd as that might sound, the data about CD sales
 actually suggest it might be close.</p>
<p>In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 percent,
 from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.12"/> This confirms a trend over the past few years. The RIAA blames
 Internet piracy for the trend, though there are many other causes that
 could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a more
 than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That no
 doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales. Rising prices could
 account for at least some of the loss. “From 1999 to 2001, the average
 price of a CD rose 7.2 percent, from $13.04 to $14.19.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.13"/>
 Competition from other forms of media could also account for some of
 the decline. As Jane Black of <i>BusinessWeek</i> notes, “The
 soundtrack to the film <i>High Fidelity</i> has a list price of $18.98.
 You could get the whole movie [on DVD] for $19.99.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.14"/></p>
<p>But let’s assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD
 sales is because of Internet sharing. Here’s the rub: In the same
 period that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA
 estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus, although
 2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, sales
 revenue fell by just 6.7 percent.</p>
<p>There are too many different things happening at the same time to
 explain these numbers definitively, but one conclusion is unavoidable:
 The recording industry constantly asks, “What’s the difference between
 downloading a song and stealing a CD?”—but their own numbers reveal
 the difference. If I steal a CD, then there is one less CD to sell.
 Every taking is a lost sale. But on the basis of the numbers the RIAA
 provides, it is absolutely clear that the same is not true of
 downloads. If every download were a lost sale—if every use of Kazaa
 “rob[bed] the author of [his] profit”—then the industry would have
 suffered a 100 percent drop in sales last year, not a 7 percent drop.
 If 2.6 times the number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, and yet
 sales revenue dropped by just 6.7 percent, then there is a huge
 difference between “downloading a song and stealing a CD.”</p>
<p>These are the harms—alleged and perhaps exaggerated but, let’s
 assume, real. What of the benefits? File sharing may impose costs on
 the recording industry. What value does it produce in addition to these
 costs?</p>
<p>One benefit is type C sharing—making available content that is
 technically still under copyright but is no longer commercially
 available. This is not a small category of content. There are millions
 of tracks that are no longer commercially available.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.15"/> And
 while it’s conceivable that some of this content is not available
 because the artist producing the content doesn’t want it to be made
 available, the vast majority of it is unavailable solely because the
 publisher or the distributor has decided it no longer makes economic
 sense <i>to the company</i> to make it available.</p>
<p>In real space—long before the Internet—the market had a simple
 response to this problem: used book and record stores. There are
 thousands of used book and used record stores in America today.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.16"/>
 These stores buy content from owners, then sell the content they buy.
 And under American copyright law, when they buy and sell this content,<i>
 even if the content is still under copyright,</i> the copyright owner
 doesn’t get a dime. Used book and record stores are commercial
 entities; their owners make money from the content they sell; but as
 with cable companies before statutory licensing, they don’t have to pay
 the copyright owner for the content they sell.</p>
<p>Type C sharing, then, is very much like used book stores or used
 record stores. It is different, of course, because the person making
 the content available isn’t making money from making the content
 available. It is also different, of course, because in real space, when
 I sell a record, I don’t have it anymore, while in cyberspace, when
 someone shares my 1949 recording of Bernstein’s “Two Love Songs,” I
 still have it. That difference would matter economically if the owner
 of the 1949 copyright were selling the record in competition to my
 sharing. But we’re talking about the class of content that is not
 currently commercially available. The Internet is making it available,
 through cooperative sharing, without competing with the market.</p>
<p>It may well be, all things considered, that it would be better if the
 copyright owner got something from this trade. But just because it may
 well be better, it doesn’t follow that it would be good to ban used
 book stores. Or put differently, if you think that type C sharing
 should be stopped, do you think that libraries and used book stores
 should be shut as well?</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, file-sharing networks enable
 type D sharing to occur—the sharing of content that copyright owners
 want to have shared or for which there is no continuing copyright. This
 sharing clearly benefits authors and society. Science fiction author
 Cory Doctorow, for example, released his first novel, <i>Down and Out
 in the Magic Kingdom,</i> both free on-line and in bookstores on the
 same day. His (and his publisher’s) thinking was that the on-line
 distribution would be a great advertisement for the “real” book. People
 would read part on-line, and then decide whether they liked the book or
 not. If they liked it, they would be more likely to buy it. Doctorow’s
 content is type D content. If sharing networks enable his work to be
 spread, then both he and society are better off. (Actually, much better
 off: It is a great book!)</p>
<p>Likewise for work in the public domain: This sharing benefits society
 with no legal harm to authors at all. If efforts to solve the problem
 of type A sharing destroy the opportunity for type D sharing, then we
 lose something important in order to protect type A content.</p>
<p>The point throughout is this: While the recording industry
 understandably says, “This is how much we’ve lost,” we must also ask,
 “How much has society gained from p2p sharing? What are the
 efficiencies? What is the content that otherwise would be unavailable?”</p>
<p>For unlike the piracy I described in the first section of this
 chapter, much of the “piracy” that file sharing enables is plainly
 legal and good. And like the piracy I described in chapter 4, much of
 this piracy is motivated by a new way of spreading content caused by
 changes in the technology of distribution. Thus, consistent with the
 tradition that gave us Hollywood, radio, the recording industry, and
 cable TV, the question we should be asking about file sharing is how
 best to preserve its benefits while minimizing (to the extent possible)
 the wrongful harm it causes artists. The question is one of balance.
 The law should seek that balance, and that balance will be found only
 with time.</p>
<p>“But isn’t the war just a war against illegal sharing? Isn’t the
 target just what you call type A sharing?”</p>
<p>You would think. And we should hope. But so far, it is not. The
 effect of the war purportedly on type A sharing alone has been felt far
 beyond that one class of sharing. That much is obvious from the Napster
 case itself. When Napster told the district court that it had developed
 a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of identified
 infringing material, the district court told counsel for Napster 99.4
 percent was not good enough. Napster had to push the infringements
 “down to zero.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.17"/></p>
<p>If 99.4 percent is not good enough, then this is a war on
 file-sharing technologies, not a war on copyright infringement. There
 is no way to assure that a p2p system is used 100 percent of the time
 in compliance with the law, any more than there is a way to assure that
 100 percent of VCRs or 100 percent of Xerox machines or 100 percent of
 handguns are used in compliance with the law. Zero tolerance means zero
 p2p. The court’s ruling means that we as a society must lose the
 benefits of p2p, even for the totally legal and beneficial uses they
 serve, simply to assure that there are zero copyright infringements
 caused by p2p.</p>
<p>Zero tolerance has not been our history. It has not produced the
 content industry that we know today. The history of American law has
 been a process of balance. As new technologies changed the way content
 was distributed, the law adjusted, after some time, to the new
 technology. In this adjustment, the law sought to ensure the legitimate
 rights of creators while protecting innovation. Sometimes this has
 meant more rights for creators. Sometimes less.</p>
<p>So, as we’ve seen, when “mechanical reproduction” threatened the
 interests of composers, Congress balanced the rights of composers
 against the interests of the recording industry. It granted rights to
 composers, but also to the recording artists: Composers were to be
 paid, but at a price set by Congress. But when radio started
 broadcasting the recordings made by these recording artists, and they
 complained to Congress that their “creative property” was not being
 respected (since the radio station did not have to pay them for the
 creativity it broadcast), Congress rejected their claim. An indirect
 benefit was enough.</p>
<p>Cable TV followed the pattern of record albums. When the courts
 rejected the claim that cable broadcasters had to pay for the content
 they rebroadcast, Congress responded by giving broadcasters a right to
 compensation, but at a level set by the law. It likewise gave cable
 companies the right to the content, so long as they paid the statutory
 price.</p>
<p>This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and player
 pianos, served two important goals—indeed, the two central goals of
 any copyright legislation. First, the law assured that new innovators
 would have the freedom to develop new ways to deliver content. Second,
 the law assured that copyright holders would be paid for the content
 that was distributed. One fear was that if Congress simply required
 cable TV to pay copyright holders whatever they demanded for their
 content, then copyright holders associated with broadcasters would use
 their power to stifle this new technology, cable. But if Congress had
 permitted cable to use broadcasters’ content for free, then it would
 have unfairly subsidized cable. Thus Congress chose a path that would
 assure <i>compensation</i> without giving the past (broadcasters)
 control over the future (cable).</p>
<p>In the same year that Congress struck this balance, two major
 producers and distributors of film content filed a lawsuit against
 another technology, the video tape recorder (VTR, or as we refer to
 them today, VCRs) that Sony had produced, the Betamax. Disney’s and
 Universal’s claim against Sony was relatively simple: Sony produced a
 device, Disney and Universal claimed, that enabled consumers to engage
 in copyright infringement. Because the device that Sony built had a
 “record” button, the device could be used to record copyrighted movies
 and shows. Sony was therefore benefiting from the copyright
 infringement of its customers. It should therefore, Disney and
 Universal claimed, be partially liable for that infringement.</p>
<p>There was something to Disney’s and Universal’s claim. Sony did
 decide to design its machine to make it very simple to record
 television shows. It could have built the machine to block or inhibit
 any direct copying from a television broadcast. Or possibly, it could
 have built the machine to copy only if there were a special “copy me” 
 signal on the line. It was clear that there were many television shows
 that did not grant anyone permission to copy. Indeed, if anyone had
 asked, no doubt the majority of shows would not have authorized
 copying. And in the face of this obvious preference, Sony could have
 designed its system to minimize the opportunity for copyright
 infringement. It did not, and for that, Disney and Universal wanted to
 hold it responsible for the architecture it chose.</p>
<p>MPAA president Jack Valenti became the studios’ most vocal champion.
 Valenti called VCRs “tapeworms.” He warned, “When there are 20, 30, 40
 million of these VCRs in the land, we will be invaded by millions of
 ’tapeworms,’ eating away at the very heart and essence of the most
 precious asset the copyright owner has, his copyright.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.18"/>
 “One does not have to be trained in sophisticated marketing and
 creative judgment,” he told Congress, “to understand the devastation on
 the after-theater marketplace caused by the hundreds of millions of
 tapings that will adversely impact on the future of the creative
 community in this country. It is simply a question of basic economics
 and plain common sense.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.19"/> Indeed, as surveys would later
 show, 45 percent of VCR owners had movie libraries of ten videos or
 more<noteref noteid="note.chap5.20"/>—a use the Court would later hold was not “fair.” By
 “allowing VCR owners to copy freely by the means of an exemption from
 copyright infringement without creating a mechanism to compensate
 copyright owners,” Valenti testified, Congress would “take from the
 owners the very essence of their property: the exclusive right to
 control who may use their work, that is, who may copy it and thereby
 profit from its reproduction.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.21"/></p>
<p>It took eight years for this case to be resolved by the Supreme
 Court. In the interim, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which
 includes Hollywood in its jurisdiction—leading Judge Alex Kozinski,
 who sits on that court, refers to it as the “Hollywood Circuit”—held
 that Sony would be liable for the copyright infringement made possible
 by its machines. Under the Ninth Circuit’s rule, this totally familiar
 technology—which Jack Valenti had called “the Boston Strangler of the
 American film industry” (worse yet, it was a <i>Japanese</i> Boston
 Strangler of the American film industry)—was an illegal technology.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.22"/></p>
<p>But the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</p>
<p>And in its reversal, the Court clearly articulated its understanding
 of when and whether courts should intervene in such disputes. As the
 Court wrote,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sound policy, as well as history, supports our consistent deference
 to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for
 copyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional authority and
 the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations
 of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new
 technology.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.23"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Congress was asked to respond to the Supreme Court’s decision. But as
 with the plea of recording artists about radio broadcasts, Congress
 ignored the request. Congress was convinced that American film got
 enough, this “taking” notwithstanding.</p>
<p>If we put these cases together, a pattern is clear:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In each case throughout our history, a new technology changed the way
 content was distributed.<noteref noteid="note.chap5.24"/> In each case, throughout our
 history, that change meant that someone got a “free ride” on someone
 else’s work.</p>
<p>In <i>none</i> of these cases did either the courts or Congress
 eliminate all free riding. In <i>none</i> of these cases did the courts
 or Congress insist that the law should assure that the copyright holder
 get all the value that his copyright created. In every case, the
 copyright owners complained of “piracy.” In every case, Congress acted
 to recognize some of the legiti macy in the behavior of the “pirates.”
 In each case, Congress allowed some new technology to benefit from
 content made before. It balanced the interests at stake.</p>
<p>When you think across these examples, and the other examples that
 make up the first four chapters of this section, this balance makes
 sense. Was Walt Disney a pirate? Would doujinshi be better if creators
 had to ask permission? Should tools that enable others to capture and
 spread images as a way to cultivate or criticize our culture be better
 regulated? Is it really right that building a search engine should
 expose you to $15 million in damages? Would it have been better if
 Edison had controlled film? Should every cover band have to hire a
 lawyer to get permission to record a song?</p>
<p>We could answer yes to each of these questions, but our tradition has
 answered no. In our tradition, as the Supreme Court has stated,
 copyright “has never accorded the copyright owner complete control over
 all possible uses of his work.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.25"/> Instead, the particular
 uses that the law regulates have been defined by balancing the good
 that comes from granting an exclusive right against the burdens such an
 exclusive right creates. And this balancing has historically been done<i>
 after</i> a technology has matured, or settled into the mix of
 technologies that facilitate the distribution of content.</p>
<p>We should be doing the same thing today. The technology of the
 Internet is changing quickly. The way people connect to the Internet
 (wires vs. wireless) is changing very quickly. No doubt the network
 should not become a tool for “stealing” from artists. But neither
 should the law become a tool to entrench one particular way in which
 artists (or more accurately, distributors) get paid. As I describe in
 some detail in the last chapter of this book, we should be securing
 income to artists while we allow the market to secure the most
 efficient way to promote and distribute content. This will require
 changes in the law, at least in the interim. These changes should be
 designed to balance the protection of the law against the strong public
 interest that innovation continue.</p>
<p>This is especially true when a new technology enables a vastly
 superior mode of distribution. And this p2p has done. P2p technologies
 can be ideally efficient in moving content across a widely diverse
 network. Left to develop, they could make the network vastly more
 efficient. Yet these “potential public benefits,” as John Schwartz
 writes in <i>The New York Times,</i> “could be delayed in the P2P
 fight.”<noteref noteid="note.chap5.26"/></p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Yet when anyone</b> begins to talk about “balance,” the copyright
 warriors raise a different argument. “All this hand waving about
 balance and incentives,” they say, “misses a fundamental point. Our
 content,” the warriors insist, “is our <i>property.</i> Why should we
 wait for Congress to ’rebalance’ our property rights? Do you have to
 wait before calling the police when your car has been stolen? And why
 should Congress deliberate at all about the merits of this theft? Do we
 ask whether the car thief had a good use for the car before we arrest
 him?”</p>
<p>“It is <i>our property,</i>” the warriors insist. “And it should be
 protected just as any other property is protected.”</p>

</page-sequence>
<page-sequence>

<h1 id="property">“PROPERTY”</h1>

</page-sequence>
<page-sequence>

<p>The copyright warriors are right: A copyright is a kind of property.
 It can be owned and sold, and the law protects against its theft.
 Ordinarily, the copyright owner gets to hold out for any price he
 wants. Markets reckon the supply and demand that partially determine
 the price she can get.</p>
<p>But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a “property” right is a
 bit misleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind of
 property. Indeed, the very idea of property in any idea or any
 expression is very odd. I understand what I am taking when I take the
 picnic table you put in your backyard. I am taking a thing, the picnic
 table, and after I take it, you don’t have it. But what am I taking
 when I take the good <i>idea</i> you had to put a picnic table in the
 backyard—by, for example, going to Sears, buying a table, and putting
 it in my backyard? What is the thing I am taking then?</p>
<p>The point is not just about the thingness of picnic tables versus
 ideas, though that’s an important difference. The point instead is that
 in the ordinary case—indeed, in practically every case except for a
 narrow range of exceptions—ideas released to the world are free. I
 don’t take anything from you when I copy the way you dress—though I
 might seem weird if I did it every day, and especially weird if you are
 a woman. Instead, as Thomas Jefferson said (and as is especially true
 when I copy the way someone else dresses), “He who receives an idea
 from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who
 lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.”<noteref noteid="note.prop1"/></p>
<p>The exceptions to free use are ideas and expressions within the reach
 of the law of patent and copyright, and a few other domains that I
 won’t discuss here. Here the law says you can’t take my idea or
 expression without my permission: The law turns the intangible into
 property.</p>
<p>But how, and to what extent, and in what form—the details, in other
 words—matter. To get a good sense of how this practice of turning the
 intangible into property emerged, we need to place this “property” in
 its proper context.<noteref noteid="note.prop2"/></p>
<p>My strategy in doing this will be the same as my strategy in the
 preceding part. I offer four stories to help put the idea of “copyright
 material is property” in context. Where did the idea come from? What
 are its limits? How does it function in practice? After these stories,
 the significance of this true statement—“copyright material is
 property”— will be a bit more clear, and its implications will be
 revealed as quite different from the implications that the copyright
 warriors would have us draw.</p>

<h2 id='ch6'>CHAPTER SIX: Founders</h2>

<p><b>William Shakespeare</b> wrote <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> in 1595. The
 play was first published in 1597. It was the eleventh major play that
 Shakespeare had written. He would continue to write plays through 1613,
 and the plays that he wrote have continued to define Anglo-American
 culture ever since. So deeply have the works of a sixteenth-century
 writer seeped into our culture that we often don’t even recognize their
 source. I once overheard someone commenting on Kenneth Branagh’s
 adaptation of Henry V: “I liked it, but Shakespeare is so full of
 clichés.”</p>
<p>In 1774, almost 180 years after <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was written,
 the “copy-right” for the work was still thought by many to be the
 exclusive right of a single London publisher, Jacob Tonson.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.1"/>
 Tonson was the most prominent of a small group of publishers called the
 Conger<noteref noteid="note.chap6.2"/> who controlled bookselling in England during the
 eighteenth century. The Conger claimed a perpetual right to control the
 “copy” of books that they had acquired from authors. That perpetual
 right meant that no one else could publish copies of a book to which
 they held the copyright. Prices of the classics were thus kept high;
 competition to produce better or cheaper editions was eliminated.</p>
<p>Now, there’s something puzzling about the year 1774 to anyone who
 knows a little about copyright law. The better-known year in the
 history of copyright is 1710, the year that the British Parliament
 adopted the first “copyright” act. Known as the Statute of Anne, the
 act stated that all published works would get a copyright term of
 fourteen years, renewable once if the author was alive, and that all
 works already published by 1710 would get a single term of twenty-one
 additional years.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.3"/> Under this law, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
 should have been free in 1731. So why was there any issue about it
 still being under Tonson’s control in 1774?</p>
<p>The reason is that the English hadn’t yet agreed on what a
“copy-right” was—indeed, no one had. At the time the English passed the
Statute of Anne, there was no other legislation governing copyrights.
The last law regulating publishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had
expired in 1695. That law gave publishers a monopoly over publishing,
as a way to make it easier for the Crown to control what was published.
But after it expired, there was no positive law that said that the
publishers, or “Stationers,” had an exclusive right to print books.</p>
<p>There was no <i>positive</i> law, but that didn’t mean that there was
 no law. The Anglo-American legal tradition looks to both the words of
 legislatures and the words of judges to know the rules that are to
 govern how people are to behave. We call the words from legislatures
 “positive law.” We call the words from judges “common law.” The common
 law sets the background against which legislatures legislate; the
 legislature, ordinarily, can trump that background only if it passes a
 law to displace it. And so the real question after the licensing
 statutes had expired was whether the common law protected a copyright,
 independent of any positive law.</p>
<p>This question was important to the publishers, or “booksellers,” as
 they were called, because there was growing competition from foreign
 publishers. The Scottish, in particular, were increasingly publishing
 and exporting books to England. That competition reduced the profits of
 the Conger, which reacted by demanding that Parliament pass a law to
 again give them exclusive control over publishing. That demand
 ultimately resulted in the Statute of Anne.</p>
<p>The Statute of Anne granted the author or “proprietor” of a book an
 exclusive right to print that book. In an important limitation,
 however, and to the horror of the booksellers, the law gave the
 bookseller that right for a limited term. At the end of that term, the
 copyright “expired,” and the work would then be free and could be
 published by anyone. Or so the legislature is thought to have believed.</p>
<p>Now, the thing to puzzle about for a moment is this: Why would
 Parliament limit the exclusive right? Not why would they limit it to
 the particular limit they set, but why would they limit the right <i>at
 all?</i></p>
<p>For the booksellers, and the authors whom they represented, had a
 very strong claim. Take <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as an example: That
 play was written by Shakespeare. It was his genius that brought it into
 the world. He didn’t take anybody’s property when he created this play
 (that’s a controversial claim, but never mind), and by his creating
 this play, he didn’t make it any harder for others to craft a play. So
 why is it that the law would ever allow someone else to come along and
 take Shakespeare’s play without his, or his estate’s, permission? What
 reason is there to allow someone else to “steal” Shakespeare’s work?</p>
<p>The answer comes in two parts. We first need to see something special
 about the notion of “copyright” that existed at the time of the Statute
 of Anne. Second, we have to see something important about
 “booksellers.”</p>
<p>First, about copyright. In the last three hundred years, we have come
 to apply the concept of “copyright” ever more broadly. But in 1710, it
 wasn’t so much a concept as it was a very particular right. The
 copyright was born as a very specific set of restrictions: It forbade
 others from reprinting a book. In 1710, the “copy-right” was a right to
 use a particular machine to replicate a particular work. It did not go
 beyond that very narrow right. It did not control any more generally
 how a work could be <i>used.</i> Today the right includes a large
 collection of restrictions on the freedom of others: It grants the
 author the exclusive right to copy, the exclusive right to distribute,
 the exclusive right to perform, and so on.</p>
<p>So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare’s works were
 perpetual, all that would have meant under the original meaning of the
 term was that no one could reprint Shakespeare’s work without the
 permission of the Shakespeare estate. It would not have controlled
 anything, for example, about how the work could be performed, whether
 the work could be translated, or whether Kenneth Branagh would be
 allowed to make his films. The “copy-right” was only an exclusive right
 to print—no less, of course, but also no more.</p>
<p>Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British.
 They had had a long and ugly experience with “exclusive rights,”
 especially “exclusive rights” granted by the Crown. The English had
 fought a civil war in part about the Crown’s practice of handing out
 monopolies—especially monopolies for works that already existed. King
 Henry VIII granted a patent to print the Bible and a monopoly to Darcy
 to print playing cards. The English Parliament began to fight back
 against this power of the Crown. In 1656, it passed the Statute of
 Monopolies, limiting monopolies to patents for new inventions. And by
 1710, Parliament was eager to deal with the growing monopoly in
 publishing.</p>
<p>Thus the “copy-right,” when viewed as a monopoly right, was naturally
 viewed as a right that should be limited. (However convincing the claim
 that “it’s my property, and I should have it forever,” try sounding
 convincing when uttering, “It’s my monopoly, and I should have it
 forever.”) The state would protect the exclusive right, but only so
 long as it benefited society. The British saw the harms from special-interest favors; they passed a law to stop them.</p>
<p>Second, about booksellers. It wasn’t just that the copyright was a
 monopoly. It was also that it was a monopoly held by the booksellers.
 Booksellers sound quaint and harmless to us. They were not viewed as
 harmless in seventeenth-century England. Members of the Conger were
 increasingly seen as monopolists of the worst kind—tools of the
 Crown’s repression, selling the liberty of England to guarantee
 themselves a monopoly profit. The attacks against these monopolists
 were harsh: Milton described them as “old patentees and monopolizers in
 the trade of book-selling”; they were “men who do not therefore labour
 in an honest profession to which learning is indetted.”<noteref noteid="note.chap6.4"/></p>
<p>Many believed the power the booksellers exercised over the spread of
 knowledge was harming that spread, just at the time the Enlightenment
 was teaching the importance of education and knowledge spread
 generally. The idea that knowledge should be free was a hallmark of the
 time, and these powerful commercial interests were interfering with
 that idea.</p>
<p>To balance this power, Parliament decided to increase competition
 among booksellers, and the simplest way to do that was to spread the
 wealth of valuable books. Parliament therefore limited the term of
 copyrights, and thereby guaranteed that valuable books would become
 open to any publisher to publish after a limited time. Thus the setting
 of the term for existing works to just twenty-one years was a
 compromise to fight the power of the booksellers. The limitation on
 terms was an indirect way to assure competition among publishers, and
 thus the construction and spread of culture.</p>
<p>When 1731 (1710 + 21) came along, however, the booksellers were
 getting anxious. They saw the consequences of more competition, and
 like every competitor, they didn’t like them. At first booksellers
 simply ignored the Statute of Anne, continuing to insist on the
 perpetual right to control publication. But in 1735 and 1737, they
 tried to persuade Parliament to extend their terms. Twenty-one years
 was not enough, they said; they needed more time.</p>
<p>Parliament rejected their requests. As one pamphleteer put it, in
 words that echo today,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see no Reason for granting a further Term now, which will not hold
 as well for granting it again and again, as often as the Old ones
 Expire; so that should this Bill pass, it will in Effect be
 establishing a perpetual Monopoly, a Thing deservedly odious in the Eye
 of the Law; it will be a great Cramp to Trade, a Discouragement to
 Learning, no Benefit to the Authors, but a general Tax on the Publick;
 and all this only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.5"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having failed in Parliament, the publishers turned to the courts in a
 series of cases. Their argument was simple and direct: The Statute of
 Anne gave authors certain protections through positive law, but those
 protections were not intended as replacements for the common law.
 Instead, they were intended simply to supplement the common law. Under
 common law, it was already wrong to take another person’s creative
 “property” and use it without his permission. The Statute of Anne, the
 booksellers argued, didn’t change that. Therefore, just because the
 protections of the Statute of Anne expired, that didn’t mean the
 protections of the common law expired: Under the common law they had
 the right to ban the publication of a book, even if its Statute of Anne
 copyright had expired. This, they argued, was the only way to protect
 authors.</p>
<p>This was a clever argument, and one that had the support of some of
 the leading jurists of the day. It also displayed extraordinary
 chutzpah. Until then, as law professor Raymond Patterson has put it,
 “The publishers . . . had as much concern for authors as a cattle
 rancher has for cattle.”<noteref noteid="note.chap6.6"/> The bookseller didn’t care squat
 for the rights of the author. His concern was the monopoly profit that
 the author’s work gave.</p>
<p>The booksellers’ argument was not accepted without a fight. The hero
 of this fight was a Scottish bookseller named Alexander Donaldson.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.7"/></p>
<p>Donaldson was an outsider to the London Conger. He began his career
 in Edinburgh in 1750. The focus of his business was inexpensive
 reprints “of standard works whose copyright term had expired,” at least
 under the Statute of Anne.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.8"/> Donaldson’s publishing house
 prospered and became “something of a center for literary Scotsmen.”</p>
<p>“[A]mong them,” Professor Mark Rose writes, was “the young James
 Boswell who, together with his friend Andrew Erskine, published an
 anthology of contemporary Scottish poems with Donaldson.”<noteref noteid="note.chap6.9"/></p>
<p>When the London booksellers tried to shut down Donaldson’s shop in
 Scotland, he responded by moving his shop to London, where he sold
 inexpensive editions “of the most popular English books, in defiance of
 the supposed common law right of Literary Property.”<noteref noteid="note.chap6.10"/> His
 books undercut the Conger prices by 30 to 50 percent, and he rested his
 right to compete upon the ground that, under the Statute of Anne, the
 works he was selling had passed out of protection.</p>
<p>The London booksellers quickly brought suit to block “piracy” like
 Donaldson’s. A number of actions were successful against the “pirates,”
 the most important early victory being <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor.</i></p>
<p>Millar was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the rights to James
 Thomson’s poem “The Seasons.” Millar complied with the requirements of
 the Statute of Anne, and therefore received the full protection of the
 statute. After the term of copyright ended, Robert Taylor began
 printing a competing volume. Millar sued, claiming a perpetual common
 law right, the Statute of Anne notwithstanding.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.11"/></p>
<p>Astonishingly to modern lawyers, one of the greatest judges in
 English history, Lord Mansfield, agreed with the booksellers. Whatever
 protection the Statute of Anne gave booksellers, it did not, he held,
 extinguish any common law right. The question was whether the common
 law would protect the author against subsequent “pirates.” Mansfield’s
 answer was yes: The common law would bar Taylor from reprinting
 Thomson’s poem without Millar’s permission. That common law rule thus
 effectively gave the booksellers a perpetual right to control the
 publication of any book assigned to them.</p>
<p>Considered as a matter of abstract justice—reasoning as if justice
 were just a matter of logical deduction from first
 principles—Mansfield’s conclusion might make some sense. But what it
 ignored was the larger issue that Parliament had struggled with in
 1710: How best to limit the monopoly power of publishers? Parliament’s
 strategy was to offer a term for existing works that was long enough to
 buy peace in 1710, but short enough to assure that culture would pass
 into competition within a reasonable period of time. Within twenty-one
 years, Parliament believed, Britain would mature from the controlled
 culture that the Crown coveted to the free culture that we inherited.</p>
<p>The fight to defend the limits of the Statute of Anne was not to end
 there, however, and it is here that Donaldson enters the mix.</p>
<p>Millar died soon after his victory, so his case was not appealed. His
 estate sold Thomson’s poems to a syndicate of printers that included
 Thomas Beckett.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.12"/> Donaldson then released an unauthorized
 edition of Thomson’s works. Beckett, on the strength of the decision in<i>
 Millar,</i> got an injunction against Donaldson. Donaldson appealed the
 case to the House of Lords, which functioned much like our own Supreme
 Court. In February of 1774, that body had the chance to interpret the
 meaning of Parliament’s limits from sixty years before.</p>
<p>As few legal cases ever do, <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i> drew
 an enormous amount of attention throughout Britain. Donaldson’s lawyers
 argued that whatever rights may have existed under the common law, the
 Statute of Anne terminated those rights. After passage of the Statute
 of Anne, the only legal protection for an exclusive right to control
 publication came from that statute. Thus, they argued, after the term
 specified in the Statute of Anne expired, works that had been protected
 by the statute were no longer protected.</p>
<p>The House of Lords was an odd institution. Legal questions were
 presented to the House and voted upon first by the “law lords,” members
 of special legal distinction who functioned much like the Justices in
 our Supreme Court. Then, after the law lords voted, the House of Lords
 generally voted.</p>
<p>The reports about the law lords’ votes are mixed. On some counts, it
 looks as if perpetual copyright prevailed. But there is no ambiguity
 about how the House of Lords voted as whole. By a two-to-one majority
 (22 to 11) they voted to reject the idea of perpetual copyrights.
 Whatever one’s understanding of the common law, now a copyright was
 fixed for a limited time, after which the work protected by copyright
 passed into the public domain.</p>
<p>“The public domain.” Before the case of <i>Donaldson</i> v.<i>
 Beckett,</i> there was no clear idea of a public domain in England.
 Before 1774, there was a strong argument that common law copyrights
 were perpetual. After 1774, the public domain was born. For the first
 time in Anglo-American history, the legal control over creative works
 expired, and the greatest works in English history—including those of
 Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton, Johnson, and Bunyan—were free of legal
 restraint.</p>
<p>It is hard for us to imagine, but this decision by the House of Lords
 fueled an extraordinarily popular and political reaction. In Scotland,
 where most of the “pirate publishers” did their work, people celebrated
 the decision in the streets. As the <i>Edinburgh Advertiser</i>
 reported, “No private cause has so much engrossed the attention of the
 public, and none has been tried before the House of Lords in the
 decision of which so many individuals were interested.”</p>
<p>“Great rejoicing in Edinburgh upon victory over literary property:
 bonfires and illuminations.”<noteref noteid="note.chap6.13"/></p>
<p>In London, however, at least among publishers, the reaction was
 equally strong in the opposite direction. The <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
 reported:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the above decision . . . near 200,000 pounds worth of what was
 honestly purchased at public sale, and which was yesterday thought
 property is now reduced to nothing. The Booksellers of London and
 Westminster, many of whom sold estates and houses to purchase
 Copy-right, are in a manner ruined, and those who after many years
 industry thought they had acquired a competency to provide for their
 families now find themselves without a shilling to devise to their
 successors.<noteref noteid="note.chap6.14"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Ruined” is a bit of an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration
 to say that the change was profound. The decision of the House of Lords
 meant that the booksellers could no longer control how culture in
 England would grow and develop. Culture in England was thereafter<i>
 free.</i> Not in the sense that copyrights would not be respected, for
 of course, for a limited time after a work was published, the
 bookseller had an exclusive right to control the publication of that
 book. And not in the sense that books could be stolen, for even after a
 copyright expired, you still had to buy the book from someone. But<i>
 free</i> in the sense that the culture and its growth would no longer
 be controlled by a small group of publishers. As every free market
 does, this free market of free culture would grow as the consumers and
 producers chose. English culture would develop as the many English
 readers chose to let it develop—chose in the books they bought and
 wrote; chose in the memes they repeated and endorsed. Chose in a<i>
 competitive context,</i> not a context in which the choices about what
 culture is available to people and how they get access to it are made
 by the few despite the wishes of the many.</p>
<p>At least, this was the rule in a world where the Parliament is
anti-monopoly, resistant to the protectionist pleas of publishers. In a
world where the Parliament is more pliant, free culture would be less
protected.</p>

<h2 id="ch7">CHAPTER SEVEN: Recorders</h2>

<p><b>Jon Else</b> is a filmmaker. He is best known for his
 documentaries and has been very successful in spreading his art. He is
 also a teacher, and as a teacher myself, I envy the loyalty and
 admiration that his students feel for him. (I met, by accident, two of
 his students at a dinner party. He was their god.)</p>
<p>Else worked on a documentary that I was involved in. At a break, he
 told me a story about the freedom to create with film in America today.</p>
<p>In 1990, Else was working on a documentary about Wagner’s Ring Cycle.
 The focus was stagehands at the San Francisco Opera. Stagehands are a
 particularly funny and colorful element of an opera. During a show,
 they hang out below the stage in the grips’ lounge and in the lighting
 loft. They make a perfect contrast to the art on the stage.</p>
<p>During one of the performances, Else was shooting some stagehands
 playing checkers. In one corner of the room was a television set.
 Playing on the television set, while the stagehands played checkers and
 the opera company played Wagner, was <i>The Simpsons.</i> As Else
 judged it, this touch of cartoon helped capture the flavor of what was
 special about the scene.</p>
<p>Years later, when he finally got funding to complete the film, Else
 attempted to clear the rights for those few seconds of <i>The Simpsons.</i>
 For of course, those few seconds are copyrighted; and of course, to use
 copyrighted material you need the permission of the copyright owner,
 unless “fair use” or some other privilege applies.</p>
<p>Else called <i>Simpsons</i> creator Matt Groening’s office to get
permission. Groening approved the shot. The shot was a
four-and-a-half-second image on a tiny television set in the corner of
the room. How could it hurt? Groening was happy to have it in the film,
but he told Else to contact Gracie Films, the company that produces the
program.</p>
<p>Gracie Films was okay with it, too, but they, like Groening, wanted
 to be careful. So they told Else to contact Fox, Gracie’s parent
 company. Else called Fox and told them about the clip in the corner of
 the one room shot of the film. Matt Groening had already given
 permission, Else said. He was just confirming the permission with Fox.</p>
<p>Then, as Else told me, “two things happened. First we discovered . .
 . that Matt Groening doesn’t own his own creation—or at least that
 someone [at Fox] believes he doesn’t own his own creation.” And second,
 Fox “wanted ten thousand dollars as a licensing fee for us to use this
 four-point-five seconds of . . . entirely unsolicited <i>Simpsons</i>
 which was in the corner of the shot.”</p>
<p>Else was certain there was a mistake. He worked his way up to someone
 he thought was a vice president for licensing, Rebecca Herrera. He
 explained to her, “There must be some mistake here. . . .</p>
<p>We’re asking for your educational rate on this.” That was the
 educational rate, Herrera told Else. A day or so later, Else called
 again to confirm what he had been told.</p>
<p>“I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight,” he told me. “Yes,
 you have your facts straight,” she said. It would cost $10,000 to use
 the clip of <i>The Simpsons</i> in the corner of a shot in a
 documentary film about Wagner’s Ring Cycle. And then, astonishingly,
 Herrera told Else, “And if you quote me, I’ll turn you over to our
 attorneys.” As an assistant to Herrera told Else later on, “They don’t
 give a shit. They just want the money.”</p>
<p>Else didn’t have the money to buy the right to replay what was
 playing on the television backstage at the San Francisco Opera.To
 reproduce this reality was beyond the documentary filmmaker’s budget.
 At the very last minute before the film was to be released, Else
 digitally replaced the shot with a clip from another film that he had
 worked on, <i>The Day After Trinity,</i> from ten years before.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>There’s no doubt</b> that someone, whether Matt Groening or Fox,
 owns the copyright to <i>The Simpsons.</i> That copyright is their
 property. To use that copyrighted material thus sometimes requires the
 permission of the copyright owner. If the use that Else wanted to make
 of the <i>Simpsons</i> copyright were one of the uses restricted by the
 law, then he would need to get the permission of the copyright owner
 before he could use the work in that way. And in a free market, it is
 the owner of the copyright who gets to set the price for any use that
 the law says the owner gets to control.</p>
<p>For example, “public performance” is a use of <i>The Simpsons</i>
 that the copyright owner gets to control. If you take a selection of
 favorite episodes, rent a movie theater, and charge for tickets to come
 see “My Favorite <i>Simpsons,</i>” then you need to get permission from
 the copyright owner. And the copyright owner (rightly, in my view) can
 charge whatever she wants—$10 or $1,000,000. That’s her right, as set
 by the law.</p>
<p>But when lawyers hear this story about Jon Else and Fox, their first
 thought is “fair use.”<noteref noteid="note.chap7.1"/> Else’s use of just 4.5 seconds of an
 indirect shot of a <i>Simpsons</i> episode is clearly a fair use of<i>
 The Simpsons</i>—and fair use does not require the permission of
 anyone.</p>
<p>So I asked Else why he didn’t just rely upon “fair use.” Here’s his
 reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>Simpsons</i> fiasco was for me a great lesson in the gulf
 between what lawyers find irrelevant in some abstract sense, and what
 is crushingly relevant in practice to those of us actually trying to
 make and broadcast documentaries. I never had any doubt that it was
 “clearly fair use” in an absolute legal sense. But I couldn’t rely on
 the concept in any concrete way. Here’s why:</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p>1. Before our films can be broadcast, the network requires that we
 buy Errors and Omissions insurance. The carriers require a detailed
 “visual cue sheet” listing the source and licensing status of each shot
 in the film. They take a dim view of “fair use,” and a claim of “fair
 use” can grind the application process to a halt.</p>

<p>2. I probably never should have asked Matt Groening in the first
 place. But I knew (at least from folklore) that Fox had a history of
 tracking down and stopping unlicensed <i>Simpsons</i> usage, just as
 George Lucas had a very high profile litigating <i>Star Wars</i> usage.
 So I decided to play by the book, thinking that we would be granted
 free or cheap license to four seconds of <i>Simpsons</i>. As a
 documentary producer working to exhaustion on a shoestring, the last
 thing I wanted was to risk legal trouble, even nuisance legal trouble,
 and even to defend a principle.</p>

<p>3. I did, in fact, speak with one of your colleagues at Stanford Law
 School . . . who confirmed that it was fair use. He also confirmed that
 Fox would “depose and litigate you to within an inch of your life,”
 regardless of the merits of my claim. He made clear that it would boil
 down to who had the bigger legal department and the deeper pockets, me
 or them.</p>

<p>4. The question of fair use usually comes up at the end of the
 project, when we are up against a release deadline and out of money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In theory, fair use means you need no permission. The theory
 therefore supports free culture and insulates against a permission
 culture. But in practice, fair use functions very differently. The
 fuzzy lines of the law, tied to the extraordinary liability if lines
 are crossed, means that the effective fair use for many types of
 creators is slight. The law has the right aim; practice has defeated
 the aim.</p>
<p>This practice shows just how far the law has come from its
 eighteenth-century roots. The law was born as a shield to protect
 publishers’ profits against the unfair competition of a pirate. It has
 matured into a sword that interferes with any use, transformative or
 not.</p>

<h2 id="ch8">CHAPTER EIGHT: Transformers</h2>

<p><b>In 1993,</b> Alex Alben was a lawyer working at Starwave, Inc.
 Starwave was an innovative company founded by Microsoft cofounder
 Paul Allen to develop digital entertainment. Long before the Internet
 became popular, Starwave began investing in new technology for
 delivering entertainment in anticipation of the power of networks.</p>
<p>Alben had a special interest in new technology. He was intrigued by
 the emerging market for CD-ROM technology—not to distribute film, but
 to do things with film that otherwise would be very difficult. In 1993,
 he launched an initiative to develop a product to build retrospectives
 on the work of particular actors. The first actor chosen was Clint
 Eastwood. The idea was to showcase all of the work of Eastwood, with
 clips from his films and interviews with figures important to his
 career.</p>
<p>At that time, Eastwood had made more than fifty films, as an actor
 and as a director. Alben began with a series of interviews with
 Eastwood, asking him about his career. Because Starwave produced those
 interviews, it was free to include them on the CD.</p>
<p>That alone would not have made a very interesting product, so
 Starwave wanted to add content from the movies in Eastwood’s career:
 posters, scripts, and other material relating to the films Eastwood
 made. Most of his career was spent at Warner Brothers, and so it was
 relatively easy to get permission for that content.</p>
<p>Then Alben and his team decided to include actual film clips. “Our
goal was that we were going to have a clip from every one of
Eastwood’s films,” Alben told me. It was here that the problem arose.
“No one had ever really done this before,” Alben explained. “No one had
ever tried to do this in the context of an artistic look at an actor’s
career.”</p>
<p>Alben brought the idea to Michael Slade, the CEO of Starwave. Slade
 asked, “Well, what will it take?”</p>
<p>Alben replied, “Well, we’re going to have to clear rights from
 everyone who appears in these films, and the music and everything else
 that we want to use in these film clips.” Slade said, “Great! Go for
 it.”<noteref noteid="note.chap8.1"/></p>
<p>The problem was that neither Alben nor Slade had any idea what
 clearing those rights would mean. Every actor in each of the films
 could have a claim to royalties for the reuse of that film. But CDROMs
 had not been specified in the contracts for the actors, so there was no
 clear way to know just what Starwave was to do.</p>
<p>I asked Alben how he dealt with the problem. With an obvious pride in
 his resourcefulness that obscured the obvious bizarreness of his tale,
 Alben recounted just what they did:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So we very mechanically went about looking up the film clips. We made
 some artistic decisions about what film clips to include—of course we
 were going to use the “Make my day” clip from <i>Dirty Harry.</i> But
 you then need to get the guy on the ground who’s wiggling under the gun
 and you need to get his permission. And then you have to decide what
 you are going to pay him.</p>

<p>We decided that it would be fair if we offered them the day-player
 rate for the right to reuse that performance. We’re talking about a
 clip of less than a minute, but to reuse that performance in the CD-ROM
 the rate at the time was about $600.</p>

<p>So we had to identify the people—some of them were hard to identify
 because in Eastwood movies you can’t tell who’s the guy crashing
 through the glass—is it the actor or is it the stuntman? And then we
 just, we put together a team, my assistant and some others, and we just
 started calling people.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Some actors were glad to help—Donald Sutherland, for example,
 followed up himself to be sure that the rights had been cleared. Others
 were dumbfounded at their good fortune. Alben would ask, “Hey, can I
 pay you $600 or maybe if you were in two films, you know, $1,200?” And
 they would say, “Are you for real? Hey, I’d love to get $1,200.” And
 some of course were a bit difficult (estranged ex-wives, in
 particular). But eventually, Alben and his team had cleared the rights
 to this retrospective CD-ROM on Clint Eastwood’s career.</p>

<p>It was one <i>year</i> later—“and even then we weren’t sure whether
 we were totally in the clear.”</p>

<p>Alben is proud of his work. The project was the first of its kind and
 the only time he knew of that a team had undertaken such a massive
 project for the purpose of releasing a retrospective.</p>
<p>Everyone thought it would be too hard. Everyone just threw up their
 hands and said, “Oh, my gosh, a film, it’s so many copyrights, there’s
 the music, there’s the screenplay, there’s the director, there’s the
 actors.” But we just broke it down. We just put it into its constituent
 parts and said, “Okay, there’s this many actors, this many directors, .
 . . this many musicians,” and we just went at it very systematically
 and cleared the rights.</p>
<p>And no doubt, the product itself was exceptionally good. Eastwood
 loved it, and it sold very well.</p>
<p>But I pressed Alben about how weird it seems that it would have to
 take a year’s work simply to clear rights. No doubt Alben had done this
 efficiently, but as Peter Drucker has famously quipped, “There is
 nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done
 at all.”<noteref noteid="note.chap8.2"/> Did it make sense, I asked Alben, that this is the
 way a new work has to be made?</p>
<p>For, as he acknowledged, “very few . . . have the time and resources,
 and the will to do this,” and thus, very few such works would ever be
 made. Does it make sense, I asked him, from the standpoint of what
 anybody really thought they were ever giving rights for originally,
 that you would have to go clear rights for these kinds of clips?</p>
<p>I don’t think so. When an actor renders a performance in a movie, he
 or she gets paid very well. . . . And then when 30 seconds of that
 performance is used in a new product that is a retrospective of
 somebody’s career, I don’t think that that person . . . should be
 compensated for that.</p>
<p>Or at least, is this <i>how</i> the artist should be compensated?
 Would it make sense, I asked, for there to be some kind of statutory
 license that someone could pay and be free to make derivative use of
 clips like this? Did it really make sense that a follow-on creator
 would have to track down every artist, actor, director, musician, and
 get explicit permission from each? Wouldn’t a lot more be created if
 the legal part of the creative process could be made to be more clean?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I think that if there were some fair-licensing
 mechanism—where you weren’t subject to hold-ups and you weren’t
 subject to estranged former spouses—you’d see a lot more of this work,
 because it wouldn’t be so daunting to try to put together a
 retrospective of someone’s career and meaningfully illustrate it with
 lots of media from that person’s career. You’d build in a cost as the
 producer of one of these things. You’d build in a cost of paying X
 dollars to the talent that performed. But it would be a known cost.
 That’s the thing that trips everybody up and makes this kind of product
 hard to get off the ground. If you knew I have a hundred minutes of
 film in this product and it’s going to cost me X, then you build your
 budget around it, and you can get investments and everything else that
 you need to produce it. But if you say, “Oh, I want a hundred minutes
 of something and I have no idea what it’s going to cost me, and a
 certain number of people are going to hold me up for money,” then it
 becomes difficult to put one of these things together.</p>
<p>Alben worked for a big company. His company was backed by some of the
 richest investors in the world. He therefore had authority and access
 that the average Web designer would not have. So if it took him a year,
 how long would it take someone else? And how much creativity is never
 made just because the costs of clearing the rights are so high?</p>
<p>These costs are the burdens of a kind of regulation. Put on a
 Republican hat for a moment, and get angry for a bit. The government
 defines the scope of these rights, and the scope defined determines how
 much it’s going to cost to negotiate them. (Remember the idea that land
 runs to the heavens, and imagine the pilot purchasing fly-through
 rights as he negotiates to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco.)
 These rights might well have once made sense; but as circumstances
 change, they make no sense at all. Or at least, a well-trained,
 regulation-minimizing Republican should look at the rights and ask,
 “Does this still make sense?”</p>
<p>I’ve seen the flash of recognition when people get this point, but
 only a few times. The first was at a conference of federal judges in
 California. The judges were gathered to discuss the emerging topic of
 cyber-law. I was asked to be on the panel. Harvey Saferstein, a
 well-respected lawyer from an L.A. firm, introduced the panel with a
 video that he and a friend, Robert Fairbank, had produced.</p>
<p>The video was a brilliant collage of film from every period in the
 twentieth century, all framed around the idea of a <i>60 Minutes</i>
 episode. The execution was perfect, down to the sixty-minute stopwatch.
 The judges loved every minute of it.</p>
<p>When the lights came up, I looked over to my copanelist, David
 Nimmer, perhaps the leading copyright scholar and practitioner in the
 nation. He had an astonished look on his face, as he peered across the
 room of over 250 well-entertained judges. Taking an ominous tone, he
 began his talk with a question: “Do you know how many federal laws were
 just violated in this room?”</p>
<p>For of course, the two brilliantly talented creators who made this
 film hadn’t done what Alben did. They hadn’t spent a year clearing the
 rights to these clips; technically, what they had done violated the
 law. Of course, it wasn’t as if they or anyone were going to be
 prosecuted for this violation (the presence of 250 judges and a gaggle
 of federal marshals notwithstanding). But Nimmer was making an
 important point: A year before anyone would have heard of the word
 Napster, and two years before another member of our panel, David Boies,
 would defend Napster before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Nimmer
 was trying to get the judges to see that the law would not be friendly
 to the capacities that this technology would enable. Technology means
 you can now do amazing things easily; but you couldn’t easily do them
 legally.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>We live in</b> a “cut and paste” culture enabled by technology.
 Anyone building a presentation knows the extraordinary freedom that the
 cut and paste architecture of the Internet created—in a second you can
 find just about any image you want; in another second, you can have it
 planted in your presentation.</p>
<p>But presentations are just a tiny beginning. Using the Internet and
 its archives, musicians are able to string together mixes of sound
 never before imagined; filmmakers are able to build movies out of clips
 on computers around the world. An extraordinary site in Sweden takes
 images of politicians and blends them with music to create biting
 political commentary. A site called Camp Chaos has produced some of the
 most biting criticism of the record industry that there is through the
 mixing of Flash! and music.</p>
<p>All of these creations are technically illegal. Even if the creators
 wanted to be “legal,” the cost of complying with the law is impossibly
 high. Therefore, for the law-abiding sorts, a wealth of creativity is
 never made. And for that part that is made, if it doesn’t follow the
 clearance rules, it doesn’t get released.</p>
<p>To some, these stories suggest a solution: Let’s alter the mix of
 rights so that people are free to build upon our culture. Free to add
 or mix as they see fit. We could even make this change without
 necessarily requiring that the “free” use be free as in “free beer.”
 Instead, the system could simply make it easy for follow-on creators to
 compensate artists without requiring an army of lawyers to come along:
 a rule, for example, that says “the royalty owed the copyright owner of
 an unregistered work for the derivative reuse of his work will be a
 flat 1 percent of net revenues, to be held in escrow for the copyright
 owner.” Under this rule, the copyright owner could benefit from some
 royalty, but he would not have the benefit of a full property right
 (meaning the right to name his own price) unless he registers the work.</p>
<p>Who could possibly object to this? And what reason would there be for
 objecting? We’re talking about work that is not now being made; which
 if made, under this plan, would produce new income for artists. What
 reason would anyone have to oppose it?</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>In February 2003,</b> DreamWorks studios announced an agreement
 with Mike Myers, the comic genius of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> and
 Austin Powers. According to the announcement, Myers and DreamWorks
 would work together to form a “unique filmmaking pact.” Under the
 agreement, DreamWorks “will acquire the rights to existing motion
 picture hits and classics, write new storylines and—with the use of
 state-of-the-art digital technology—insert Myers and other actors
 into the film, thereby creating an entirely new piece of
 entertainment.”</p>
<p>The announcement called this “film sampling.” As Myers explained,
 “Film Sampling is an exciting way to put an original spin on existing
 films and allow audiences to see old movies in a new light. Rap artists
 have been doing this for years with music and now we are able to take
 that same concept and apply it to film.” Steven Spielberg is quoted as
 saying, “If anyone can create a way to bring old films to new
 audiences, it is Mike.”</p>
<p>Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if
 you don’t think about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point
 about this announcement. As the vast majority of our film heritage
 remains under copyright, the real meaning of the DreamWorks
 announcement is just this: It is Mike Myers and only Mike Myers who is
 free to sample. Any general freedom to build upon the film archive of
 our culture, a freedom in other contexts presumed for us all, is now a
 privilege reserved for the funny and famous—and presumably rich.</p>
<p>This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first
 continues the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of “fair use.”
 Much of “sampling” should be considered “fair use.” But few would rely
 upon so weak a doctrine to create. That leads to the second reason that
 the privilege is reserved for the few: The costs of negotiating the
 legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high.
 These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either pay a lawyer to
 defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions
 so you don’t have to rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the
 creative process is a process of paying lawyers—again a privilege, or
 perhaps a curse, reserved for the few.</p>

<h2 id="ch9">CHAPTER NINE: Collectors</h2>

<p><b>In April 1996,</b> millions of “bots”—computer codes designed to
 “spider,” or automatically search the Internet and copy content—began
 running across the Net. Page by page, these bots copied Internet-based
 information onto a small set of computers located in a basement in San
 Francisco’s Presidio. Once the bots finished the whole of the Internet,
 they started again. Over and over again, once every two months, these
 bits of code took copies of the Internet and stored them.</p>
<p>By October 2001, the bots had collected more than five years of
 copies. And at a small announcement in Berkeley, California, the
 archive that these copies created, the Internet Archive, was opened to
 the world. Using a technology called “the Way Back Machine,” you could
 enter a Web page, and see all of its copies going back to 1996, as well
 as when those pages changed.</p>
<p>This is the thing about the Internet that Orwell would have
 appreciated. In the dystopia described in <i>1984,</i> old newspapers
 were constantly updated to assure that the current view of the world,
 approved of by the government, was not contradicted by previous news
 reports. Thousands of workers constantly reedited the past, meaning
 there was no way ever to know whether the story you were reading today
 was the story that was printed on the date published on the paper.</p>
<p>It’s the same with the Internet. If you go to a Web page today,
 there’s no way for you to know whether the content you are reading is
 the same as the content you read before. The page may seem the same,
 but the content could easily be different. The Internet is Orwell’s
 library—constantly updated, without any reliable memory.</p>
<p>Until the Way Back Machine, at least. With the Way Back Machine, and
 the Internet Archive underlying it, you can see what the Internet was.
 You have the power to see what you remember. More importantly, perhaps,
 you also have the power to find what you don’t remember and what others
 might prefer you forget.<noteref noteid="note.chap9.1"/></p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>We take it</b> for granted that we can go back to see what we
 remember reading. Think about newspapers. If you wanted to study the
 reaction of your hometown newspaper to the race riots in Watts in 1965,
 or to Bull Connor’s water cannon in 1963, you could go to your public
 library and look at the newspapers. Those papers probably exist on
 microfiche. If you’re lucky, they exist in paper, too. Either way, you
 are free, using a library, to go back and remember—not just what it is
 convenient to remember, but remember something close to the truth.</p>
<p>It is said that those who fail to remember history are doomed to
 repeat it.That’s not quite correct. We <i>all</i> forget history.The
 key is whether we have a way to go back to rediscover what we forget.
 More directly, the key is whether an objective past can keep us honest.
 Libraries help do that, by collecting content and keeping it, for
 schoolchildren, for researchers, for grandma. A free society presumes
 this knowedge.</p>
<p>The Internet was an exception to this presumption. Until the Internet
 Archive, there was no way to go back. The Internet was the
 quintessentially transitory medium. And yet, as it becomes more
 important in forming and reforming society, it becomes more and more
 important to maintain in some historical form. It’s just bizarre to
 think that we have scads of archives of newspapers from tiny towns
 around the world, yet there is but one copy of the Internet—the one
 kept by the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>Brewster Kahle is the founder of the Internet Archive. He was a very
 successful Internet entrepreneur after he was a successful computer
 researcher. In the 1990s, Kahle decided he had had enough business
 success. It was time to become a different kind of success. So he
 launched a series of projects designed to archive human knowledge. The
 Internet Archive was just the first of the projects of this Andrew
 Carnegie of the Internet. By December of 2002, the archive had over 10
 billion pages, and it was growing at about a billion pages a month.</p>
<p>The Way Back Machine is the largest archive of human knowledge in
 human history. At the end of 2002, it held “two hundred and thirty
 terabytes of material”—and was “ten times larger than the Library of
 Congress.” And this was just the first of the archives that Kahle set
 out to build. In addition to the Internet Archive, Kahle has been
 constructing the Television Archive. Television, it turns out, is even
 more ephemeral than the Internet. While much of twentieth-century
 culture was constructed through television, only a tiny proportion of
 that culture is available for anyone to see today. Three hours of news
 are recorded each evening by Vanderbilt University—thanks to a
 specific exemption in the copyright law.That content is indexed, and is
 available to scholars for a very low fee. “But other than that,
 [television] is almost unavailable,” Kahle told me. “If you were
 Barbara Walters you could get access to [the archives], but if you are
 just a graduate student?” As Kahle put it,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you remember when Dan Quayle was interacting with Murphy Brown?
 Remember that back and forth surreal experience of a politician
 interacting with a fictional television character? If you were a
 graduate student wanting to study that, and you wanted to get those
 original back and forth exchanges between the two, the <i>60 Minutes</i>
 episode that came out after it . . . it would be almost impossible. . .
 . Those materials are almost unfindable. . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that? Why is it that the part of our culture that is recorded
 in newspapers remains perpetually accessible, while the part that is
 recorded on videotape is not? How is it that we’ve created a world
 where researchers trying to understand the effect of media on
 nineteenth-century America will have an easier time than researchers
 trying to understand the effect of media on twentieth-century America?</p>
<p>In part, this is because of the law. Early in American copyright law,
 copyright owners were required to deposit copies of their work in
 libraries. These copies were intended both to facilitate the spread of
 knowledge and to assure that a copy of the work would be around once
 the copyright expired, so that others might access and copy the work.</p>
<p>These rules applied to film as well. But in 1915, the Library of
 Congress made an exception for film. Film could be copyrighted so long
 as such deposits were made. But the filmmaker was then allowed to
 borrow back the deposits—for an unlimited time at no cost. In 1915
 alone, there were more than 5,475 films deposited and “borrowed back.”
 Thus, when the copyrights to films expire, there is no copy held by any
 library. The copy exists—if it exists at all—in the library archive
 of the film company.<noteref noteid="note.chap9.2"/></p>
<p>The same is generally true about television. Television broadcasts
were originally not copyrighted—there was no way to capture the
broadcasts, so there was no fear of “theft.” But as technology enabled
capturing, broadcasters relied increasingly upon the law. The law
required they make a copy of each broadcast for the work to be
“copy-righted.” But those copies were simply kept by the broadcasters.
No library had any right to them; the government didn’t demand them.
The content of this part of American culture is practically invisible
to anyone who would look.</p>
<p>Kahle was eager to correct this. Before September 11, 2001, he and
 his allies had started capturing television. They selected twenty
 stations from around the world and hit the Record button. After
 September 11, Kahle, working with dozens of others, selected twenty
 stations from around the world and, beginning October 11, 2001, made
 their coverage during the week of September 11 available free on-line.
 Anyone could see how news reports from around the world covered the
 events of that day.</p>
<p>Kahle had the same idea with film. Working with Rick Prelinger, whose
 archive of film includes close to 45,000 “ephemeral films” (meaning
 films other than Hollywood movies, films that were never copyrighted),
 Kahle established the Movie Archive. Prelinger let Kahle digitize 1,300
 films in this archive and post those films on the Internet to be
 downloaded for free. Prelinger’s is a for-profit company. It sells
 copies of these films as stock footage. What he has discovered is that
 after he made a significant chunk available for free, his stock footage
 sales went up dramatically. People could easily find the material they
 wanted to use. Some downloaded that material and made films on their
 own. Others purchased copies to enable other films to be made. Either
 way, the archive enabled access to this important part of our culture.
 Want to see a copy of the “Duck and Cover” film that instructed
 children how to save themselves in the middle of nuclear attack? Go to
 archive.org, and you can download the film in a few minutes—for free.</p>
<p>Here again, Kahle is providing access to a part of our culture that
 we otherwise could not get easily, if at all. It is yet another part of
 what defines the twentieth century that we have lost to history. The
 law doesn’t require these copies to be kept by anyone, or to be
 deposited in an archive by anyone. Therefore, there is no simple way to
 find them.</p>
<p>The key here is access, not price. Kahle wants to enable free access
 to this content, but he also wants to enable others to sell access to
 it. His aim is to ensure competition in access to this important part
 of our culture. Not during the commercial life of a bit of creative
 property, but during a second life that all creative property has—a
 noncommercial life.</p>
<p>For here is an idea that we should more clearly recognize. Every bit
 of creative property goes through different “lives.” In its first life,
 if the creator is lucky, the content is sold. In such cases the
 commercial market is successful for the creator. The vast majority of
 creative property doesn’t enjoy such success, but some clearly does.
 For that content, commercial life is extremely important. Without this
 commercial market, there would be, many argue, much less creativity.</p>
<p>After the commercial life of creative property has ended, our
 tradition has always supported a second life as well. A newspaper
 delivers the news every day to the doorsteps of America. The very next
 day, it is used to wrap fish or to fill boxes with fragile gifts or to
 build an archive of knowledge about our history. In this second life,
 the content can continue to inform even if that information is no
 longer sold.</p>
<p>The same has always been true about books. A book goes out of print
 very quickly (the average today is after about a year<noteref noteid="note.chap9.3"/>).
 After it is out of print, it can be sold in used book stores without
 the copyright owner getting anything and stored in libraries, where
 many get to read the book, also for free. Used book stores and
 libraries are thus the second life of a book. That second life is
 extremely important to the spread and stability of culture.</p>
<p>Yet increasingly, any assumption about a stable second life for
 creative property does not hold true with the most important components
 of popular culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For
 these—television, movies, music, radio, the Internet—there is no
 guarantee of a second life. For these sorts of culture, it is as if
 we’ve replaced libraries with Barnes &amp; Noble superstores. With this
 culture, what’s accessible is nothing but what a certain limited market
 demands. Beyond that, culture disappears.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>For most of</b> the twentieth century, it was economics that made
 this so. It would have been insanely expensive to collect and make
 accessible all television and film and music: The cost of analog copies
 is extraordinarily high. So even though the law in principle would have
 restricted the ability of a Brewster Kahle to copy culture generally,
 the real restriction was economics. The market made it impossibly
 difficult to do anything about this ephemeral culture; the law had
 little practical effect.</p>
<p>Perhaps the single most important feature of the digital revolution
 is that for the first time since the Library of Alexandria, it is
 feasible to imagine constructing archives that hold all culture
 produced or distributed publicly. Technology makes it possible to
 imagine an archive of all books published, and increasingly makes it
 possible to imagine an archive of all moving images and sound.</p>
<p>The scale of this potential archive is something we’ve never imagined
 before. The Brewster Kahles of our history have dreamed about it; but
 we are for the first time at a point where that dream is possible. As
 Kahle describes,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It looks like there’s about two to three million recordings of music.
 Ever. There are about a hundred thousand theatrical releases of movies,
 . . . and about one to two million movies [distributed] during the
 twentieth century. There are about twenty-six million different titles
 of books. All of these would fit on computers that would fit in this
 room and be able to be afforded by a small company. So we’re at a
 turning point in our history. Universal access is the goal. And the
 opportunity of leading a different life, based on this, is . . .
 thrilling. It could be one of the things humankind would be most proud
 of. Up there with the Library of Alexandria, putting a man on the moon,
 and the invention of the printing press.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kahle is not the only librarian. The Internet Archive is not the only
 archive. But Kahle and the Internet Archive suggest what the future of
 libraries or archives could be. <i>When</i> the commercial life of
 creative property ends, I don’t know. But it does. And whenever it
 does, Kahle and his archive hint at a world where this knowledge, and
 culture, remains perpetually available. Some will draw upon it to
 understand it; some to criticize it. Some will use it, as Walt Disney
 did, to re-create the past for the future. These technologies promise
 something that had become unimaginable for much of our past—a future<i>
 for</i> our past. The technology of digital arts could make the dream
 of the Library of Alexandria real again.</p>
<p>Technologists have thus removed the economic costs of building such
an archive. But lawyers’ costs remain. For as much as we might like to
call these “archives,” as warm as the idea of a “library” might seem,
the “content” that is collected in these digital spaces is also
someone’s “property.” And the law of property restricts the freedoms
that Kahle and others would exercise.</p>

<h2 id="ch10">CHAPTER TEN: “Property”</h2>

<p><b>Jack Valenti</b> has been the president of the Motion Picture
 Association of America since 1966. He first came to Washington, D.C.,
 with Lyndon Johnson’s administration—literally. The famous picture of
 Johnson’s swearing-in on Air Force One after the assassination of
 President Kennedy has Valenti in the background. In his almost forty
 years of running the MPAA, Valenti has established himself as perhaps
 the most prominent and effective lobbyist in Washington.</p>
<p>The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion Picture
 Association. It was formed in 1922 as a trade association whose goal
 was to defend American movies against increasing domestic criticism.
 The organization now represents not only filmmakers but producers and
 distributors of entertainment for television, video, and cable. Its
 board is made up of the chairmen and presidents of the seven major
 producers and distributors of motion picture and television programs in
 the United States: Walt Disney, Sony Pictures Entertainment, MGM,
 Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal Studios, and
 Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president before
 him has had as much influence over that organization, or over
 Washington. As a Texan, Valenti has mastered the single most important
 political skill of a Southerner—the ability to appear simple and slow
 while hiding a lightning-fast intellect. To this day, Valenti plays the
 simple, humble man. But this Harvard MBA, and author of four books, who
 finished high school at the age of fifteen and flew more than fifty
 combat missions in World War II, is no Mr. Smith. When Valenti went to
 Washington, he mastered the city in a quintessentially Washingtonian
 way.</p>
<p>In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our
 culture depends upon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting the
 MPAA rating system, it has probably avoided a great deal of
 speech-regulating harm. But there is an aspect to the organization’s
 mission that is both the most radical and the most important. This is
 the organization’s effort, epitomized in Valenti’s every act, to
 redefine the meaning of “creative property.”</p>
<p>In 1982, Valenti’s testimony to Congress captured the strategy
 perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges and the
 counter-charges, no matter the tumult and the shouting, reasonable men
 and women will keep returning to the fundamental issue, the central
 theme which animates this entire debate: <i>Creative property owners
 must be accorded the same rights and protection resident in all other
 property owners in the nation.</i> That is the issue. That is the
 question. And that is the rostrum on which this entire hearing and the
 debates to follow must rest.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.1"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of Valenti’s
 rhetoric, is brilliant and simple and brilliant because simple. The
 “central theme” to which “reasonable men and women” will return is
 this: “Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and
 protections resident in all other property owners in the nation.” There
 are no second-class citizens, Valenti might have continued. There
 should be no second-class property owners.</p>
<p>This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is stated
 with such clarity as to make the idea as obvious as the notion that we
 use elections to pick presidents. But in fact, there is no more extreme
 a claim made by <i>anyone</i> who is serious in this debate than this
 claim of Valenti’s. Jack Valenti, however sweet and however brilliant,
 is perhaps the nation’s foremost extremist when it comes to the nature
 and scope of “creative property.” His views have <i>no</i> reasonable
 connection to our actual legal tradition, even if the subtle pull of
 his Texan charm has slowly redefined that tradition, at least in
 Washington.</p>
<p>While “creative property” is certainly “property” in a nerdy and
 precise sense that lawyers are trained to understand,<noteref noteid="note.chap10.2"/> it
 has never been the case, nor should it be, that “creative property
 owners” have been “accorded the same rights and protection resident
 in all other property owners.” Indeed, if creative property owners were
 given the same rights as all other property owners, that would effect a
 radical, and radically undesirable, change in our tradition.</p>
<p>Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares squat
 for our tradition and the values it represents. He speaks for an
 industry that is instead fighting to restore the tradition that the
 British overturned in 1710. In the world that Valenti’s changes would
 create, a powerful few would exercise powerful control over how our
 creative culture would develop.</p>
<p>I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince you
 that, historically, Valenti’s claim is absolutely wrong. The second is
 to convince you that it would be terribly wrong for us to reject our
 history. We have always treated rights in creative property differently
 from the rights resident in all other property owners. They have never
 been the same. And they should never be the same, because, however
 counterintuitive this may seem, to make them the same would be to
 fundamentally weaken the opportunity for new creators to create.
 Creativity depends upon the owners of creativity having less than
 perfect control.</p>
<p>Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most
 powerful of the old guard, have little interest, their rhetoric
 notwithstanding, in assuring that the new can displace them. No
 organization does. No person does. (Ask me about tenure, for example.)
 But what’s good for the MPAA is not necessarily good for America. A
 society that defends the ideals of free culture must preserve precisely
 the opportunity for new creativity to threaten the old.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>To get</b> just a hint that there is something fundamentally wrong
 in Valenti’s argument, we need look no further than the United States
 Constitution itself.</p>
<p>The framers of our Constitution loved “property.” Indeed, so strongly
 did they love property that they built into the Constitution an
 important requirement. If the government takes your property—if it
 condemns your house, or acquires a slice of land from your farm—it is
 required, under the Fifth Amendment’s “Takings Clause,” to pay you
 “just compensation” for that taking. The Constitution thus guarantees
 that property is, in a certain sense, sacred. It cannot <i>ever</i> be
 taken from the property owner unless the government pays for the
 privilege.</p>
<p>Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about what
 Valenti calls “creative property.” In the clause granting Congress the
 power to create “creative property,” the Constitution <i>requires</i>
 that after a “limited time,” Congress take back the rights that it has
 granted and set the “creative property” free to the public domain. Yet
 when Congress does this, when the expiration of a copyright term
 “takes” your copyright and turns it over to the public domain, Congress
 does not have any obligation to pay “just compensation” for this
 “taking.” Instead, the same Constitution that requires compensation for
 your land requires that you lose your “creative property” right without
 any compensation at all.</p>
<p>The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of
 property are not to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly to be
 treated differently. Valenti is therefore not just asking for a change
 in our tradition when he argues that creative-property owners should be
 accorded the same rights as every other property-right owner. He is
 effectively arguing for a change in our Constitution itself.</p>
<p>Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily wrong.
 There was much in our original Constitution that was plainly wrong. The
 Constitution of 1789 entrenched slavery; it left senators to be
 appointed rather than elected; it made it possible for the electoral
 college to produce a tie between the president and his own vice
 president (as it did in 1800). The framers were no doubt extraordinary,
 but I would be the first to admit that they made big mistakes. We have
 since rejected some of those mistakes; no doubt there could be others
 that we should reject as well. So my argument is not simply that
 because Jefferson did it, we should, too.</p>
<p>Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should at
 least try to understand <i>why.</i> Why did the framers, fanatical
 property types that they were, reject the claim that creative property
 be given the same rights as all other property? Why did they require
 that for creative property there must be a public domain?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the
 history of these “creative property” rights, and the control that they
 enabled. Once we see clearly how differently these rights have been
 defined, we will be in a better position to ask the question that
 should be at the core of this war: Not <i>whether</i> creative property
 should be protected, but how. Not <i>whether</i> we will enforce the
 rights the law gives to creative-property owners, but what the
 particular mix of rights ought to be. Not <i>whether</i> artists should
 be paid, but whether institutions designed to assure that artists get
 paid need also control how culture develops.</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk about
 how property is protected. More precisely, we need a more general way
 than the narrow language of the law allows. In <i>Code and Other Laws
 of Cyberspace,</i> I used a simple model to capture this more general
 perspective. For any particular right or regulation, this model asks
 how four different modalities of regulation interact to support or
 weaken the right or regulation. I represented it with this diagram:</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture2.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual or
 group that is the target of regulation, or the holder of a right. (In
 each case throughout, we can describe this either as regulation or as a
 right. For simplicity’s sake, I will speak only of regulations.) The
 ovals represent four ways in which the individual or group might be
 regulated—either constrained or, alternatively, enabled. Law is the
 most obvious constraint (to lawyers, at least). It constrains by
 threatening punishments after the fact if the rules set in advance are
 violated. So if, for example, you willfully infringe Madonna’s
 copyright by copying a song from her latest CD and posting it on the
 Web, you can be punished with a $150,000 fine. The fine is an ex post
 punishment for violating an ex ante rule. It is imposed by the state.</p>
<p>Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an
 individual for violating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is
 imposed by a community, not (or not only) by the state. There may be no
 law against spitting, but that doesn’t mean you won’t be punished if
 you spit on the ground while standing in line at a movie. The
 punishment might not be harsh, though depending upon the community, it
 could easily be more harsh than many of the punishments imposed by the
 state. The mark of the difference is not the severity of the rule, but
 the source of the enforcement.</p>
<p>The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is effected
 through conditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you’ll be paid M if you
 do N. These constraints are obviously not independent of law or
 norms—it is property law that defines what must be bought if it is to
 be taken legally; it is norms that say what is appropriately sold. But
 given a set of norms, and a background of property and contract law,
 the market imposes a simultaneous constraint upon how an individual or
 group might behave.</p>
<p>Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously,
 “architecture”—the physical world as one finds it—is a constraint on
 behavior. A fallen bridge might constrain your ability to get across a
 river. Railroad tracks might constrain the ability of a community to
 integrate its social life. As with the market, architecture does not
 effect its constraint through ex post punishments. Instead, also as
 with the market, architecture effects its constraint through
 simultaneous conditions. These conditions are imposed not by courts
 enforcing contracts, or by police punishing theft, but by nature, by
 “architecture.” If a 500-pound boulder blocks your way, it is the law
 of gravity that enforces this constraint. If a $500 airplane ticket
 stands between you and a flight to New York, it is the market that
 enforces this constraint.</p>
<p>So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is
 obvious: They interact. Restrictions imposed by one might be reinforced
 by another. Or restrictions imposed by one might be undermined by
 another.</p>
<p>The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the
 effective freedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any
 particular thing, we have to consider how these four modalities
 interact. Whether or not there are other constraints (there may well
 be; my claim is not about comprehensiveness), these four are among the
 most significant, and any regulator (whether controlling or freeing)
 must consider how these four in particular interact.</p>
<p>So, for example, consider the “freedom” to drive a car at a high
 speed. That freedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits that
 say how fast you can drive in particular places at particular times. It
 is in part restricted by architecture: speed bumps, for example, slow
 most rational drivers; governors in buses, as another example, set the
 maximum rate at which the driver can drive. The freedom is in part
 restricted by the market: Fuel efficiency drops as speed increases,
 thus the price of gasoline indirectly constrains speed. And finally,
 the norms of a community may or may not constrain the freedom to speed.
 Drive at 50 mph by a school in your own neighborhood and you’re likely
 to be punished by the neighbors. The same norm wouldn’t be as effective
 in a different town, or at night.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture18.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>The final point about this simple model should also be fairly clear:
 While these four modalities are analytically independent, law has a
 special role in affecting the three.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.3"/> The law, in other
 words, sometimes operates to increase or decrease the constraint of a
 particular modality. Thus, the law might be used to increase taxes on
 gasoline, so as to increase the incentives to drive more slowly. The
 law might be used to mandate more speed bumps, so as to increase the
 difficulty of driving rapidly. The law might be used to fund ads that
 stigmatize reckless driving. Or the law might be used to require that
 other laws be more strict—a federal requirement that states decrease
 the speed limit, for example—so as to decrease the attractiveness of
 fast driving.</p>
<p>These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To
 understand the effective protection of liberty or protection of
 property at any particular moment, we must track these changes over
 time. A restriction imposed by one modality might be erased by another.
 A freedom enabled by one modality might be displaced by another.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.4"/></p>

<h2 id='ch10.1'>Why Hollywood Is Right</h2>

<p>The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or just
 how, Hollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied Congress
 and the courts to defend copyright. This model helps us see why that
 rallying makes sense.</p>
<p>Let’s say this is the picture of copyright’s regulation before the
 Internet:</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture19.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture. The
 law limits the ability to copy and share content, by imposing penalties
 on those who copy and share content. Those penalties are reinforced by
 technologies that make it hard to copy and share content (architecture)
 and expensive to copy and share content (market). Finally, those
 penalties are mitigated by norms we all recognize—kids, for example,
 taping other kids’ records. These uses of copyrighted material may well
 be infringement, but the norms of our society (before the Internet, at
 least) had no problem with this form of infringement.</p>
<p>Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as MP3s and
 p2p sharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes dramatically,
 as does the constraint of the market. And as both the market and
 architecture relax the regulation of copyright, norms pile on. The
 happy balance (for the warriors, at least) of life before the Internet
 becomes an effective state of anarchy after the Internet.</p>
<p>Thus the sense of, and justification for, the warriors’ response.
 Technology has changed, the warriors say, and the effect of this
 change, when ramified through the market and norms, is that a balance
 of protection for the copyright owners’ rights has been lost.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture20.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p> This is Iraq after the fall of Saddam, but this time no government
 is justifying the looting that results.</p>
<p>Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to the
 warriors. Indeed, in a “White Paper” prepared by the Commerce
 Department (one heavily influenced by the copyright warriors) in 1995, this mix of regulatory modalities had already been identified and
 the strategy to respond already mapped. In response to the changes the
 Internet had effected, the White Paper argued (1) Congress should
 strengthen intellectual property law, (2) businesses should adopt
 innovative marketing techniques, (3) technologists should push to
 develop code to protect copyrighted material, and (4) educators should
 educate kids to better protect copyright.</p>
<p>This mixed strategy is just what copyright needed—if it was to
 preserve the particular balance that existed before the change induced
 by the Internet. And it’s just what we should expect the content
 industry to push for. It is as American as apple pie to consider the
 happy life you have as an entitlement, and to look to the law to
 protect it if something comes along to change that happy life.
 Homeowners living in a flood plain have no hesitation appealing to the
 government to rebuild (and rebuild again) when a flood (architecture)
 wipes away their property (law). Farmers have no hesitation appealing
 to the government to bail them out when a virus (architecture)
 devastates their crop. Unions have no hesitation appealing to the
 government to bail them out when imports (market) wipe out the U.S.
 steel industry.</p>
<p>Thus, there’s nothing wrong or surprising in the content industry’s
 campaign to protect itself from the harmful consequences of a
 technological innovation. And I would be the last person to argue that
 the changing technology of the Internet has not had a profound effect
 on the content industry’s way of doing business, or as John Seely Brown
 describes it, its “architecture of revenue.”</p>
<p>But just because a particular interest asks for government support,
 it doesn’t follow that support should be granted. And just because
 technology has weakened a particular way of doing business, it doesn’t
 follow that the government should intervene to support that old way of
 doing business. Kodak, for example, has lost perhaps as much as 20
 percent of their traditional film market to the emerging technologies
 of digital cameras.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.5"/> Does anyone believe the government
 should ban digital cameras just to support Kodak? Highways have
 weakened the freight business for railroads. Does anyone think we
 should ban trucks from roads <i>for the purpose of</i> protecting the
 railroads? Closer to the subject of this book, remote channel changers
 have weakened the “stickiness” of television advertising (if a boring
 commercial comes on the TV, the remote makes it easy to surf ), and it
 may well be that this change has weakened the television advertising
 market. But does anyone believe we should regulate remotes to reinforce
 commercial television? (Maybe by limiting them to function only once a
 second, or to switch to only ten channels within an hour?)</p>
<p>The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is no. In
 a free society, with a free market, supported by free enterprise and
 free trade, the government’s role is not to support one way of doing
 business against others. Its role is not to pick winners and protect
 them against loss. If the government did this generally, then we would
 never have any progress. As Microsoft chairman Bill Gates wrote in
 1991, in a memo criticizing software patents, “established companies
 have an interest in excluding future competitors.”<noteref noteid="note.chap10.6"/> And
 relative to a startup, established companies also have the means.
 (Think RCA and FM radio.) A world in which competitors with new ideas
 must fight not only the market but also the government is a world in
 which competitors with new ideas will not succeed. It is a world of
 stasis and increasingly concentrated stagnation. It is the Soviet Union
 under Brezhnev.</p>
<p>Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with new
 technologies that change the way they do business to look to the
 government for protection, it is the special duty of policy makers to
 guarantee that that protection not become a deterrent to progress. It
 is the duty of policy makers, in other words, to assure that the
 changes they create, in response to the request of those hurt by
 changing technology, are changes that preserve the incentives and
 opportunities for innovation and change.</p>
<p>In the context of laws regulating speech—which include, obviously,
 copyright law—that duty is even stronger. When the industry
 complaining about changing technologies is asking Congress to respond
 in a way that burdens speech and creativity, policy makers should be
 especially wary of the request. It is always a bad deal for the
 government to get into the business of regulating speech markets. The
 risks and dangers of that game are precisely why our framers created
 the First Amendment to our Constitution: “Congress shall make no law .
 . . abridging the freedom of speech.” So when Congress is being asked
 to pass laws that would “abridge” the freedom of speech, it should
 ask—carefully—whether such regulation is justified.</p>
<p>My argument just now, however, has nothing to do with whether the
 changes that are being pushed by the copyright warriors are
 “justified.” My argument is about their effect. For before we get to
 the question of justification, a hard question that depends a great
 deal upon your values, we should first ask whether we understand the
 effect of the changes the content industry wants.</p>
<p>Here’s the metaphor that will capture the argument to follow. In
 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss chemist
 Paul Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize for his work demonstrating the
 insecticidal properties of DDT. By the 1950s, the insecticide was
 widely used around the world to kill disease-carrying pests. It was
 also used to increase farm production.</p>
<p>No one doubts that killing disease-carrying pests or increasing crop
 production is a good thing. No one doubts that the work of Müller was
 important and valuable and probably saved lives, possibly millions.</p>
<p>But in 1962, Rachel Carson published <i>Silent Spring,</i> which
 argued that DDT, whatever its primary benefits, was also having
 unintended environmental consequences. Birds were losing the ability to
 reproduce. Whole chains of the ecology were being destroyed.</p>
<p>No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul Müller certainly did
 not aim to harm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of problems
 produced another set which, in the view of some, was far worse than the
 problems that were originally attacked. Or more accurately, the
 problems DDT caused were worse than the problems it solved, at least
 when considering the other, more environmentally friendly ways to solve
 the problems that DDT was meant to solve.</p>
<p>It is to this image precisely that Duke University law professor
 James Boyle appeals when he argues that we need an “environmentalism”
 for culture.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.7"/> His point, and the point I want to develop in
 the balance of this chapter, is not that the aims of copyright are
 flawed. Or that authors should not be paid for their work. Or that
 music should be given away “for free.” The point is that some of the
 ways in which we might protect authors will have unintended
 consequences for the cultural environment, much like DDT had for the
 natural environment. And just as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement
 of malaria or an attack on farmers, so, too, is criticism of one
 particular set of regulations protecting copyright not an endorsement
 of anarchy or an attack on authors. It is an environment of creativity
 that we seek, and we should be aware of our actions’ effects on the
 environment.</p>
<p>My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map exactly
 this effect. No doubt the technology of the Internet has had a dramatic
 effect on the ability of copyright owners to protect their content. But
 there should also be little doubt that when you add together the
 changes in copyright law over time, plus the change in technology that
 the Internet is undergoing just now, the net effect of these changes
 will not be only that copyrighted work is effectively protected. Also,
 and generally missed, the net effect of this massive increase in
 protection will be devastating to the environment for creativity.</p>
<p>In a line: To kill a gnat, we are spraying DDT with consequences for
 free culture that will be far more devastating than that this gnat will
 be lost.</p>


<h2 id='ch10.2'>Beginnings</h2>

<p>America copied English copyright law. Actually, we copied and
 improved English copyright law. Our Constitution makes the purpose of
 “creative property” rights clear; its express limitations reinforce the
 English aim to avoid overly powerful publishers.</p>
<p>The power to establish “creative property” rights is granted to
 Congress in a way that, for our Constitution, at least, is very odd.
 Article I, section 8, clause 8 of our Constitution states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science and useful
 Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the
 exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can call this the “Progress Clause,” for notice what this clause
 does not say. It does not say Congress has the power to grant “creative
 property rights.” It says that Congress has the power <i>to promote
 progress.</i> The grant of power is its purpose, and its purpose is a
 public one, not the purpose of enriching publishers, nor even primarily
 the purpose of rewarding authors.</p>
<p>The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As we
 saw in chapter 6, the English limited the term of copyright so as to
 assure that a few would not exercise disproportionate control over
 culture by exercising disproportionate control over publishing. We can
 assume the framers followed the English for a similar purpose. Indeed,
 unlike the English, the framers reinforced that objective, by requiring
 that copyrights extend “to Authors” only.</p>
<p>The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the
 Constitution’s design in general. To avoid a problem, the framers built
 structure. To prevent the concentrated power of publishers, they built
 a structure that kept copyrights away from publishers and kept them
 short. To prevent the concentrated power of a church, they banned the
 federal government from establishing a church. To prevent concentrating
 power in the federal government, they built structures to reinforce the
 power of the states—including the Senate, whose members were at the
 time selected by the states, and an electoral college, also selected by
 the states, to select the president. In each case, a <i>structure</i>
 built checks and balances into the constitutional frame, structured to
 prevent otherwise inevitable concentrations of power.</p>
<p>I doubt the framers would recognize the regulation we call
“copy-right” today. The scope of that regulation is far beyond anything
they ever considered. To begin to understand what they did, we need to
put our “copyright” in context: We need to see how it has changed in
the 210 years since they first struck its design.</p>
<p>Some of these changes come from the law: some in light of changes in
 technology, and some in light of changes in technology given a
 particular concentration of market power. In terms of our model, we
 started here:</p>

<p>We will end here:</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture3.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>Let me explain how.</p>

<h2 id='ch10.3'>Law: Duration</h2>

<p>When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative property, it
 faced the same uncertainty about the status of creative property that
 the English had confronted in 1774. Many states had passed laws
 protecting creative property, and some believed that these laws simply
 supplemented common law rights that already protected creative
 authorship.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.8"/> This meant that there was no guaranteed public
 domain in the United States in 1790. If copyrights were protected by
 the common law, then there was no simple way to know whether a work
 published in the United States was controlled or free. Just as in
 England, this lingering uncertainty would make it hard for publishers
 to rely upon a public domain to reprint and distribute works.</p>
<p>That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation granting
 copyrights. Because federal law overrides any contrary state law,
 federal protections for copyrighted works displaced any state law
 protections. Just as in England the Statute of Anne eventually meant
 that the copyrights for all English works expired, a federal statute
 meant that any state copyrights expired as well.</p>
<p>In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a
 federal copyright and secured that copyright for fourteen years. If the
 author was alive at the end of that fourteen years, then he could opt
 to renew the copyright for another fourteen years. If he did not renew
 the copyright, his work passed into the public domain.</p>
<p>While there were many works created in the United States in the first
 ten years of the Republic, only 5 percent of the works were actually
 registered under the federal copyright regime. Of all the work created
 in the United States both before 1790 and from 1790 through 1800, 95
 percent immediately passed into the public domain; the balance would
 pass into the pubic domain within twenty-eight years at most, and more
 likely within fourteen years.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.9"/></p>
<p>This system of renewal was a crucial part of the American system of
 copyright. It assured that the maximum terms of copyright would be
 granted only for works where they were wanted. After the initial term
 of fourteen years, if it wasn’t worth it to an author to renew his
 copyright, then it wasn’t worth it to society to insist on the
 copyright, either.</p>
<p>Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast majority of
 copyright owners at that time, it was long enough: Only a small
 minority of them renewed their copyright after fourteen years; the
 balance allowed their work to pass into the public domain.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.10"/></p>
<p>Even today, this structure would make sense. Most creative work has
 an actual commercial life of just a couple of years. Most books fall
 out of print after one year.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.11"/> When that happens, the used
 books are traded free of copyright regulation. Thus the books are no
 longer <i>effectively</i> controlled by copyright. The only practical
 commercial use of the books at that time is to sell the books as used
 books; that use—because it does not involve publication—is
 effectively free.</p>
<p>In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of copyright was
 changed once. In 1831, the term was increased from a maximum of 28
 years to a maximum of 42 by increasing the initial term of copyright
 from 14 years to 28 years. In the next fifty years of the Republic, the
 term increased once again. In 1909, Congress extended the renewal term
 of 14 years to 28 years, setting a maximum term of 56 years.</p>
<p>Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has defined
 copyright law since. Eleven times in the last forty years, Congress has
 extended the terms of existing copyrights; twice in those forty years,
 Congress extended the term of future copyrights. Initially, the
 extensions of existing copyrights were short, a mere one to two years.
 In 1976, Congress extended all existing copyrights by nineteen years.
 And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, Congress
 extended the term of existing and future copyrights by twenty years.</p>
<p>The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the
 passing of works into the public domain. This latest extension means
 that the public domain will have been tolled for thirty-nine out of
 fifty-five years, or 70 percent of the time since 1962. Thus, in the
 twenty years after the Sonny Bono Act, while one million patents will
 pass into the public domain, zero copyrights will pass into the public
 domain by virtue of the expiration of a copyright term.</p>
<p>The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another,
 little-noticed change in the copyright law. Remember I said that the
 framers established a two-part copyright regime, requiring a copyright
 owner to renew his copyright after an initial term. The requirement of
 renewal meant that works that no longer needed copyright protection
 would pass more quickly into the public domain. The works remaining
 under protection would be those that had some continuing commercial
 value.</p>
<p>The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For all
 works created after 1978, there was only one copyright term—the
 maximum term. For “natural” authors, that term was life plus fifty
 years. For corporations, the term was seventy-five years. Then, in
 1992, Congress abandoned the renewal requirement for all works created
 before 1978. All works still under copyright would be accorded the
 maximum term then available. After the Sonny Bono Act, that term was
 ninety-five years.</p>
<p>This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic way to
 assure that works that were no longer exploited passed into the public
 domain. And indeed, after these changes, it is unclear whether it is
 even possible to put works into the public domain. The public domain is
 orphaned by these changes in copyright law. Despite the requirement
 that terms be “limited,” we have no evidence that anything will limit
 them.</p>
<p>The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright is
 dramatic. In 1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners failed to
 renew their copyright. That meant that the average term of copyright in
 1973 was just 32.2 years. Because of the elimination of the renewal
 requirement, the average term of copyright is now the maximum term. In
 thirty years, then, the average term has tripled, from 32.2 years to 95
 years.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.12"/></p>

<h2 id='ch10.4'>Law: Scope</h2>

<p>The “scope” of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the law.
 The scope of American copyright has changed dramatically. Those changes
 are not necessarily bad. But we should understand the extent of the
 changes if we’re to keep this debate in context.</p>
<p>In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only “maps,
 charts, and books.” That means it didn’t cover, for example, music or
 architecture. More significantly, the right granted by a copyright gave
 the author the exclusive right to “publish” copyrighted works. That
 means someone else violated the copyright only if he republished the
 work without the copyright owner’s permission. Finally, the right
 granted by a copyright was an exclusive right to that particular book.
 The right did not extend to what lawyers call “derivative works.” It
 would not, therefore, interfere with the right of someone other than
 the author to translate a copyrighted book, or to adapt the story to a
 different form (such as a drama based on a published book).</p>
<p>This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of copyright
 today are extremely hard to describe simply, in general terms, the
 right covers practically any creative work that is reduced to a
 tangible form. It covers music as well as architecture, drama as well
 as computer programs. It gives the copyright owner of that creative
 work not only the exclusive right to “publish” the work, but also the
 exclusive right of control over any “copies” of that work. And most
 significant for our purposes here, the right gives the copyright owner
 control over not only his or her particular work, but also any
 “derivative work” that might grow out of the original work. In this
 way, the right covers more creative work, protects the creative work
 more broadly, and protects works that are based in a significant way on
 the initial creative work.</p>
<p>At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded, procedural
 limitations on the right have been relaxed. I’ve already described the
 complete removal of the renewal requirement in 1992. In addition to the
 renewal requirement, for most of the history of American copyright law,
 there was a requirement that a work be registered before it could
 receive the protection of a copyright. There was also a requirement
 that any copyrighted work be marked either with that famous © or the
 word <i>copyright.</i> And for most of the history of American
 copyright law, there was a requirement that works be deposited with the
 government before a copyright could be secured.</p>
<p>The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible
 understanding that for most works, no copyright was required. Again, in
 the first ten years of the Republic, 95 percent of works eligible for
 copyright were never copyrighted. Thus, the rule reflected the norm:
 Most works apparently didn’t need copyright, so registration narrowed
 the regulation of the law to the few that did. The same reasoning
 justified the requirement that a work be marked as copyrighted—that
 way it was easy to know whether a copyright was being claimed. The
 requirement that works be deposited was to assure that after the
 copyright expired, there would be a copy of the work somewhere so that
 it could be copied by others without locating the original author.</p>
<p>All of these “formalities” were abolished in the American system when
 we decided to follow European copyright law. There is no requirement
 that you register a work to get a copyright; the copyright now is
 automatic; the copyright exists whether or not you mark your work with
 a ©; and the copyright exists whether or not you actually make a copy
 available for others to copy.</p>
<p>Consider a practical example to understand the scope of these
 differences.</p>
<p>If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent who
 actually copyrighted that book, then the copyright law protected you
 against another publisher’s taking your book and republishing it
 without your permission. The aim of the act was to regulate publishers
 so as to prevent that kind of unfair competition. In 1790, there were
 174 publishers in the United States.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.13"/> The Copyright Act was
 thus a tiny regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of the
 creative market in the United States—publishers.</p>
<p>The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied your
 poem by hand, over and over again, as a way to learn it by heart, my
 act was totally unregulated by the 1790 act. If I took your novel and
 made a play based upon it, or if I translated it or abridged it, none
 of those activities were regulated by the original copyright act. These
 creative activities remained free, while the activities of publishers
 were restrained.</p>
<p>Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your book is
 automatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every e-mail,
 every note to your spouse, every doodle, <i>every</i> creative act
 that’s reduced to a tangible form—all of this is automatically
 copyrighted. There is no need to register or mark your work. The
 protection follows the creation, not the steps you take to protect it.</p>
<p>That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range of
 fair use exceptions) to control how others copy the work, whether they
 copy it to republish it or to share an excerpt.</p>
<p>That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would control
 competing publishing. But there’s a second part to the copyright of
 today that is not at all obvious. This is the protection of “derivative
 rights.” If you write a book, no one can make a movie out of your book
 without permission. No one can translate it without permission.
 CliffsNotes can’t make an abridgment unless permission is granted. All
 of these derivative uses of your original work are controlled by the
 copyright holder. The copyright, in other words, is now not just an
 exclusive right to your writings, but an exclusive right to your
 writings and a large proportion of the writings inspired by them.</p>
<p>It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our
 framers, though it has become second nature to us. Initially, this
 expansion was created to deal with obvious evasions of a narrower
 copyright. If I write a book, can you change one word and then claim a
 copyright in a new and different book? Obviously that would make a joke
 of the copyright, so the law was properly expanded to include those
 slight modifications as well as the verbatim original work.</p>
<p>In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power within
 a free culture—at least, it’s astonishing when you understand that the
 law applies not just to the commercial publisher but to anyone with a
 computer. I understand the wrong in duplicating and selling someone
 else’s work. But whatever <i>that</i> wrong is, transforming someone
 else’s work is a different wrong. Some view transformation as no wrong
 at all—they believe that our law, as the framers penned it, should not
 protect derivative rights at all.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.14"/> Whether or not you go
 that far, it seems plain that whatever wrong is involved is
 fundamentally different from the wrong of direct piracy.</p>
<p>Yet copyright law treats these two different wrongs in the same way.
 I can go to court and get an injunction against your pirating my book.
 I can go to court and get an injunction against your transformative use
 of my book.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.15"/> These two different uses of my creative work
 are treated the same.</p>
<p>This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why should
 you be able to write a movie that takes my story and makes money from
 it without paying me or crediting me? Or if Disney creates a creature
 called “Mickey Mouse,” why should you be able to make Mickey Mouse toys
 and be the one to trade on the value that Disney originally created?</p>
<p>These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that the
 derivative right is unjustified. My aim just now is much narrower:
 simply to make clear that this expansion is a significant change from
 the rights originally granted.</p>

<h2 id='ch10.5'>Law and Architecture: Reach</h2>

<p>Whereas originally the law regulated only publishers, the change in
 copyright’s scope means that the law today regulates publishers, users,
 and authors. It regulates them because all three are capable of making
 copies, and the core of the regulation of copyright law is copies.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.16"/></p>
<p>“Copies.” That certainly sounds like the obvious thing for <i>copy</i>
right law to regulate. But as with Jack Valenti’s argument at the start
 of this chapter, that “creative property” deserves the “same rights” as
 all other property, it is the <i>obvious</i> that we need to be most
 careful about. For while it may be obvious that in the world before the
 Internet, copies were the obvious trigger for copyright law, upon
 reflection, it should be obvious that in the world with the Internet,
 copies should <i>not</i> be the trigger for copyright law. More
 precisely, they should not <i>always</i> be the trigger for copyright
 law.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take this
 very slowly so that the point is not easily missed. My claim is that
 the Internet should at least force us to rethink the conditions under
 which the law of copyright automatically applies,<noteref noteid="note.chap10.17"/> because
 it is clear that the current reach of copyright was never contemplated,
 much less chosen, by the legislators who enacted copyright law.</p>
<p>We can see this point abstractly by beginning with this largely empty
 circle.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture4.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to
 represent all its potential <i>uses.</i> Most of these uses are
 unregulated by copyright law, because the uses don’t create a copy. If
 you read a book, that act is not regulated by copyright law. If you
 give someone the book, that act is not regulated by copyright law. If
 you resell a book, that act is not regulated (copyright law expressly
 states that after the first sale of a book, the copyright owner can
 impose no further conditions on the disposition of the book). If you
 sleep on the book or use it to hold up a lamp or let your puppy chew it
 up, those acts are not regulated by copyright law, because those acts
 do not make a copy.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture5.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are regulated by
 copyright law. Republishing the book, for example, makes a copy. It is
 therefore regulated by copyright law. Indeed, this particular use
 stands at the core of this circle of possible uses of a copyrighted
 work. It is the paradigmatic use properly regulated by copyright
 regulation (see first diagram on next page).</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture6.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>Finally, there is a tiny sliver of otherwise regulated copying uses
 that remain unregulated because the law considers these “fair uses.”</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture7.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p> These are uses that themselves involve copying, but which the law
 treats as unregulated because public policy demands that they remain
 unregulated. You are free to quote from this book, even in a review
 that is quite negative, without my permission, even though that quoting
 makes a copy. That copy would ordinarily give the copyright owner the
 exclusive right to say whether the copy is allowed or not, but the law
 denies the owner any exclusive right over such “fair uses” for public
 policy (and possibly First Amendment) reasons.</p>
<p>In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided into
 three sorts: (1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3)
 regulated uses that are nonetheless deemed “fair” regardless of the
 copyright owner’s views.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture8.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>Enter the Internet—a distributed, digital network where every use of
 a copyrighted work produces a copy.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.18"/> And because of this
 single, arbitrary feature of the design of a digital network, the scope
 of category 1 changes dramatically. Uses that before were presumptively
 unregulated are now presumptively regulated. No longer is there a set
 of presumptively unregulated uses that define a freedom associated with
 a copyrighted work. Instead, each use is now subject to the copyright,
 because each use also makes a copy—category 1 gets sucked into
 category 2. And those who would defend the unregulated uses of
 copyrighted work must look exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to
 bear the burden of this shift.</p>
<p>So let’s be very specific to make this general point clear. Before
 the Internet, if you purchased a book and read it ten times, there
 would be no plausible <i>copyright</i>-related argument that the
 copyright owner could make to control that use of her book. Copyright
 law would have nothing to say about whether you read the book once, ten
 times, or every night before you went to bed. None of those instances
 of use—reading—could be regulated by copyright law because none of
 those uses produced a copy.</p>
<p>But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a different
 set of rules. Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book
 only once or only once a month, then <i>copyright law</i> would aid the
 copyright owner in exercising this degree of control, because of the
 accidental feature of copyright law that triggers its application upon
 there being a copy. Now if you read the book ten times and the license
 says you may read it only five times, then whenever you read the book
 (or any portion of it) beyond the fifth time, you are making a copy of
 the book contrary to the copyright owner’s wish.</p>
<p>There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim just
 now is not to argue about whether it makes sense or not. My aim is only
 to make clear the change. Once you see this point, a few other points
 also become clear:</p>
<p>First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker
 ever intended. Congress did not think through the collapse of the
 presumptively unregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is no
 evidence at all that policy makers had this idea in mind when they
 allowed our policy here to shift. Unregulated uses were an important
 part of free culture before the Internet.</p>
<p>Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of
 transformative uses of creative content. Again, we can all understand
 the wrong in commercial piracy. But the law now purports to regulate<i>
 any</i> transformation you make of creative work using a machine. “Copy
 and paste” and “cut and paste” become crimes. Tinkering with a story
 and releasing it to others exposes the tinkerer to at least a
 requirement of justification. However troubling the expansion with
 respect to copying a particular work, it is extraordinarily troubling
 with respect to transformative uses of creative work.</p>
<p>Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary
 burden on category 3 (“fair use”) that fair use never before had to
 bear. If a copyright owner now tried to control how many times I could
 read a book on-line, the natural response would be to argue that this
 is a violation of my fair use rights. But there has never been any
 litigation about whether I have a fair use right to read, because
 before the Internet, reading did not trigger the application of
 copyright law and hence the need for a fair use defense. The right to
 read was effectively protected before because reading was not
 regulated.</p>
<p>This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates for
 free culture. We have been cornered into arguing that our rights depend
 upon fair use—never even addressing the earlier question about the
 expansion in effective regulation. A thin protection grounded in fair
 use makes sense when the vast majority of uses are <i>unregulated.</i>
 But when everything becomes presumptively regulated, then the
 protections of fair use are not enough.</p>
<p>The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was in
 the business of making “trailer” advertisements for movies available to
 video stores. The video stores displayed the trailers as a way to sell
 videos. Video Pipeline got the trailers from the film distributors, put
 the trailers on tape, and sold the tapes to the retail stores.</p>
<p>The company did this for about fifteen years. Then, in 1997, it began
 to think about the Internet as another way to distribute these
 previews. The idea was to expand their “selling by sampling” technique
 by giving on-line stores the same ability to enable “browsing.” Just as
 in a bookstore you can read a few pages of a book before you buy the
 book, so, too, you would be able to sample a bit from the movie on-line
 before you bought it.</p>
<p>In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film distributors
 that it intended to distribute the trailers through the Internet
 (rather than sending the tapes) to distributors of their videos. Two
 years later, Disney told Video Pipeline to stop. The owner of Video
 Pipeline asked Disney to talk about the matter—he had built a business
 on distributing this content as a way to help sell Disney films; he had
 customers who depended upon his delivering this content. Disney would
 agree to talk only if Video Pipeline stopped the distribution
 immediately. Video Pipeline thought it was within their “fair use”
 rights to distribute the clips as they had. So they filed a lawsuit to
 ask the court to declare that these rights were in fact their rights.</p>
<p>Disney countersued—for $100 million in damages. Those damages were
 predicated upon a claim that Video Pipeline had “willfully infringed”
 on Disney’s copyright. When a court makes a finding of willful
 infringement, it can award damages not on the basis of the actual harm
 to the copyright owner, but on the basis of an amount set in the
 statute. Because Video Pipeline had distributed seven hundred clips of
 Disney movies to enable video stores to sell copies of those movies,
 Disney was now suing Video Pipeline for $100 million.</p>
<p>Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the
 video stores that were selling Disney’s films also had some sort of
 right to be able to sell the films that they had bought from Disney.
 Disney’s claim in court was that the stores were allowed to sell the
 films and they were permitted to list the titles of the films they were
 selling, but they were not allowed to show clips of the films as a way
 of selling them without Disney’s permission.</p>
<p>Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the courts
 would consider it a close case. My point here is to map the change that
 gives Disney this power. Before the Internet, Disney couldn’t really
 control how people got access to their content. Once a video was in the
 marketplace, the “first-sale doctrine” would free the seller to use the
 video as he wished, including showing portions of it in order to
 engender sales of the entire movie video. But with the Internet, it
 becomes possible for Disney to centralize control over access to this
 content. Because each use of the Internet produces a copy, use on the
 Internet becomes subject to the copyright owner’s control. The
 technology expands the scope of effective control, because the
 technology builds a copy into every transaction.</p>
<p>No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential for
 control is not yet the abuse of control. Barnes &amp; Noble has the right
 to say you can’t touch a book in their store; property law gives them
 that right. But the market effectively protects against that abuse. If
 Barnes &amp; Noble banned browsing, then consumers would choose other
 bookstores. Competition protects against the extremes. And it may well
 be (my argument so far does not even question this) that competition
 would prevent any similar danger when it comes to copyright. Sure,
 publishers exercising the rights that authors have assigned to them
 might try to regulate how many times you read a book, or try to stop
 you from sharing the book with anyone. But in a competitive market such
 as the book market, the dangers of this happening are quite slight.</p>
<p>Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this changed
 architecture enables. Enabling technology to enforce the control of
 copyright means that the control of copyright is no longer defined by
 balanced policy. The control of copyright is simply what private owners
 choose. In some contexts, at least, that fact is harmless. But in some
 contexts it is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<h2 id='ch10.6'>Architecture and Law: Force</h2>

<p>The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough, but a
 second important change brought about by the Internet magnifies its
 significance. This second change does not affect the reach of copyright
 regulation; it affects how such regulation is enforced.</p>
<p>In the world before digital technology, it was generally the law that
 controlled whether and how someone was regulated by copyright law. The
 law, meaning a court, meaning a judge: In the end, it was a human,
 trained in the tradition of the law and cognizant of the balances that
 tradition embraced, who said whether and how the law would restrict
 your freedom.</p>
<p>There’s a famous story about a battle between the Marx Brothers and Warner Brothers. The Marxes intended to make a parody of <i>Casablanca.</i> Warner Brothers objected. They wrote a nasty letter to the Marxes, warning them that there would be serious legal consequences if they went forward with their plan.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.19"/></p>
<p>This led the Marx Brothers to respond in kind. They warned Warner Brothers that the Marx Brothers “were brothers long before you were.”<noteref noteid="note.chap10.20"/> The Marx Brothers therefore owned the word <i>brothers,</i> and if Warner Brothers insisted on trying to control <i>Casablanca,</i> then the Marx Brothers would insist on control over <i>brothers.</i></p>
<p>An absurd and hollow threat, of course, because Warner Brothers, like the Marx Brothers, knew that no court would ever enforce such a silly claim. This extremism was irrelevant to the real freedoms anyone (including Warner Brothers) enjoyed.</p>
<p>On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules, because on the Internet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a human but by a machine: Increasingly, the rules of copyright law, as interpreted by the copyright owner, get built into the technology that delivers copyrighted content. It is code, rather than law, that rules. And the problem with code regulations is that, unlike law, code has no shame. Code would not get the humor of the Marx Brothers. The consequence of that is not at all funny.</p>
<p>Consider the life of my Adobe eBook Reader.</p>
<p>An e-book is a book delivered in electronic form. An Adobe eBook is not a book that Adobe has published; Adobe simply produces the software that publishers use to deliver e-books. It provides the technology, and the publisher delivers the content by using the technology.</p>
<p>On the next page is a picture of an old version of my Adobe eBook Reader.</p>
<p>As you can see, I have a small collection of e-books within this e-book library. Some of these books reproduce content that is in the public domain: <i>Middlemarch,</i> for example, is in the public domain. Some of them reproduce content that is not in the public domain: My own book <i>The Future of Ideas</i> is not yet within the public domain.</p>

<p>Consider <i>Middlemarch</i> first. If you click on my e-book copy of <i>Middlemarch,</i> you’ll see a fancy cover, and then a button at the bottom called Permissions.</p>
<p>If you click on the Permissions button, you’ll see a list of the permissions that the publisher purports to grant with this book.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture10.jpg" alt='screenshot'/>

<p>According to my eBook Reader, I have the permission to copy to the clipboard of the computer ten text selections every ten days. (So far, I’ve copied no text to the clipboard.) I also have the permission to print ten pages from the book every ten days. Lastly, I have the permission to use the Read Aloud button to hear <i>Middlemarch</i> read aloud through the computer.</p>
<p>Here’s the e-book for another work in the public domain (including the translation): Aristotle’s <i>Politics.</i></p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture11.jpg" alt='screenshot'/>

<p>According to its permissions, no printing or copying is permitted at all. But fortunately, you can use the Read Aloud button to hear the book.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture12.jpg" alt='screenshot'/>

<p>Finally (and most embarrassingly), here are the permissions for the original e-book version of my last book, <i>The Future of Ideas</i>:</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture14.jpg" alt='screenshot'/>

<p>No copying, no printing, and don’t you dare try to listen to this book! Now, the Adobe eBook Reader calls these controls “permissions”—as if the publisher has the power to control how you use these works. For works under copyright, the copyright owner certainly does have the power—up to the limits of the copyright law. But for work not under copyright, there is no such copyright power.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.21"/> When my e-book of <i>Middlemarch</i> says I have the permission to copy only ten text selections into the memory every ten days, what that really means is that the eBook Reader has enabled the publisher to control how I use the book on my computer, far beyond the control that the law would enable.</p>

<p>The control comes instead from the code—from the technology within which the e-book “lives.” Though the e-book says that these are permissions, they are not the sort of “permissions” that most of us deal with. When a teenager gets “permission” to stay out till midnight, she knows (unless she’s Cinderella) that she can stay out till 2 A.M., but will suffer a punishment if she’s caught. But when the Adobe eBook Reader says I have the permission to make ten copies of the text into the computer’s memory, that means that after I’ve made ten copies, the computer will not make any more. The same with the printing restrictions: After ten pages, the eBook Reader will not print any more pages. It’s the same with the silly restriction that says that you can’t use the Read Aloud button to read my book aloud—it’s not that the company will sue you if you do; instead, if you push the Read Aloud button with my book, the machine simply won’t read aloud.</p>
<p>These are <i>controls,</i> not permissions. Imagine a world where the Marx Brothers sold word processing software that, when you tried to type “Warner Brothers,” erased “Brothers” from the sentence.</p>
<p>This is the future of copyright law: not so much copyright <i>law</i> as copyright <i>code.</i> The controls over access to content will not be controls that are ratified by courts; the controls over access to content will be controls that are coded by programmers. And whereas the controls that are built into the law are always to be checked by a judge, the controls that are built into the technology have no similar built-in check.</p>
<p>How significant is this? Isn’t it always possible to get around the controls built into the technology? Software used to be sold with technologies that limited the ability of users to copy the software, but those were trivial protections to defeat. Why won’t it be trivial to defeat these protections as well?</p>
<p>We’ve only scratched the surface of this story. Return to the Adobe eBook Reader.</p>
<p>Early in the life of the Adobe eBook Reader, Adobe suffered a public relations nightmare. Among the books that you could download for free on the Adobe site was a copy of <i>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.</i> This wonderful book is in the public domain. Yet when you clicked on Permissions for that book, you got the following report:</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture15.jpg" alt='screenshot'/>

<p>Here was a public domain children’s book that you were not allowed to copy, not allowed to lend, not allowed to give, and, as the “permissions” indicated, not allowed to “read aloud”!</p>
<p>The public relations nightmare attached to that final permission. For the text did not say that you were not permitted to use the Read Aloud button; it said you did not have the permission to read the book aloud. That led some people to think that Adobe was restricting the right of parents, for example, to read the book to their children, which seemed, to say the least, absurd.</p>
<p>Adobe responded quickly that it was absurd to think that it was trying to restrict the right to read a book aloud. Obviously it was only restricting the ability to use the Read Aloud button to have the book read aloud. But the question Adobe never did answer is this: Would Adobe thus agree that a consumer was free to use software to hack around the restrictions built into the eBook Reader? If some company (call it Elcomsoft) developed a program to disable the technological protection built into an Adobe eBook so that a blind person, say, could use a computer to read the book aloud, would Adobe agree that such a use of an eBook Reader was fair? Adobe didn’t answer because the answer, however absurd it might seem, is no.</p>
<p>The point is not to blame Adobe. Indeed, Adobe is among the most innovative companies developing strategies to balance open access to content with incentives for companies to innovate. But Adobe’s technology enables control, and Adobe has an incentive to defend this control. That incentive is understandable, yet what it creates is often crazy.</p>
<p>To see the point in a particularly absurd context, consider a favorite story of mine that makes the same point.</p>
<p>Consider the robotic dog made by Sony named “Aibo.” The Aibo learns tricks, cuddles, and follows you around. It eats only electricity and that doesn’t leave that much of a mess (at least in your house).</p>
<p>The Aibo is expensive and popular. Fans from around the world have set up clubs to trade stories. One fan in particular set up a Web site to enable information about the Aibo dog to be shared. This fan set up aibopet.com (and aibohack.com, but that resolves to the same site), and on that site he provided information about how to teach an Aibo to do tricks in addition to the ones Sony had taught it.</p>
<p>“Teach” here has a special meaning. Aibos are just cute computers. You teach a computer how to do something by programming it differently. So to say that aibopet.com was giving information about how to teach the dog to do new tricks is just to say that aibopet.com was giving information to users of the Aibo pet about how to hack their computer “dog” to make it do new tricks (thus, aibohack.com).</p>
<p>If you’re not a programmer or don’t know many programmers, the word <i>hack</i> has a particularly unfriendly connotation. Nonprogrammers hack bushes or weeds. Nonprogrammers in horror movies do even worse. But to programmers, or coders, as I call them, <i>hack</i> is a much more positive term. <i>Hack</i> just means code that enables the program to do something it wasn’t originally intended or enabled to do. If you buy a new printer for an old computer, you might find the old computer doesn’t run, or “drive,” the printer. If you discovered that, you’d later be happy to discover a hack on the Net by someone who has written a driver to enable the computer to drive the printer you just bought.</p>
<p>Some hacks are easy. Some are unbelievably hard. Hackers as a community like to challenge themselves and others with increasingly difficult tasks. There’s a certain respect that goes with the talent to hack well. There’s a well-deserved respect that goes with the talent to hack ethically.</p>
<p>The Aibo fan was displaying a bit of both when he hacked the program and offered to the world a bit of code that would enable the Aibo to dance jazz. The dog wasn’t programmed to dance jazz. It was a clever bit of tinkering that turned the dog into a more talented creature than Sony had built.</p>
<p>I’ve told this story in many contexts, both inside and outside the United States. Once I was asked by a puzzled member of the audience, is it permissible for a dog to dance jazz in the United States? We forget that stories about the backcountry still flow across much of the world. So let’s just be clear before we continue: It’s not a crime anywhere (anymore) to dance jazz. Nor is it a crime to teach your dog to dance jazz. Nor should it be a crime (though we don’t have a lot to go on here) to teach your robot dog to dance jazz. Dancing jazz is a completely legal activity. One imagines that the owner of aibopet.com thought, <i>What possible problem could there be with teaching a robot dog to dance?</i></p>
<p>Let’s put the dog to sleep for a minute, and turn to a pony show—not literally a pony show, but rather a paper that a Princeton academic named Ed Felten prepared for a conference. This Princeton academic is well known and respected. He was hired by the government in the Microsoft case to test Microsoft’s claims about what could and could not be done with its own code. In that trial, he demonstrated both his brilliance and his coolness. Under heavy badgering by Microsoft lawyers, Ed Felten stood his ground. He was not about to be bullied into being silent about something he knew very well.</p>
<p>But Felten’s bravery was really tested in April 2001.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.22"/> He and a group of colleagues were working on a paper to be submitted at conference. The paper was intended to describe the weakness in an encryption system being developed by the Secure Digital Music Initiative as a technique to control the distribution of music.</p>
<p>The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable content owners to exercise much better control over their content than the Internet, as it originally stood, granted them. Using encryption, SDMI hoped to develop a standard that would allow the content owner to say “this music cannot be copied,” and have a computer respect that command. The technology was to be part of a “trusted system” of control that would get content owners to trust the system of the Internet much more.</p>
<p>When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a competition. In exchange for providing contestants with the code to an SDMI-encrypted bit of content, contestants were to try to crack it and, if they did, report the problems to the consortium.</p>
<p>Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly. He and the team saw the weakness of this system as a type: Many encryption systems would suffer the same weakness, and Felten and his team thought it worthwhile to point this out to those who study encryption.</p>
<p>Let’s review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the United States. We have a principle of free speech. We have this principle not just because it is the law, but also because it is a really great idea. A strongly protected tradition of free speech is likely to encourage a wide range of criticism. That criticism is likely, in turn, to improve the systems or people or ideas criticized.</p>
<p>What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper describing the weakness in a technology. They were not spreading free music, or building and deploying this technology. The paper was an academic essay, unintelligible to most people. But it clearly showed the weakness in the SDMI system, and why SDMI would not, as presently constituted, succeed.</p>
<p>What links these two, aibopet.com and Felten, is the letters they then received. Aibopet.com received a letter from Sony about the aibopet.com hack. Though a jazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal, Sony wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your site contains information providing the means to circumvent
 AIBO-ware’s copy protection protocol constituting a violation of the
 anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system of
 encryption should also be perfectly legal, Felten received a letter
 from an RIAA lawyer that read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any disclosure of information gained from participating in the Public
 Challenge would be outside the scope of activities permitted by the
 Agreement and could subject you and your research team to actions under
 the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control the
 spread of information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act made
 spreading such information an offense.</p>
<p>The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners’ first fear
 about cyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was effectively
 dead; the response was to find technologies that might compensate.
 These new technologies would be copyright protection technologies—technologies to control the replication and distribution of copyrighted
 material. They were designed as <i>code</i> to modify the original<i>
 code</i> of the Internet, to reestablish some protection for copyright
 owners.</p>
<p>The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of this
 code designed to protect copyrighted material. It was, we could say,<i>
 legal code</i> intended to buttress <i>software code</i> which itself
 was intended to support the <i>legal code of copyright.</i></p>
<p>But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted works to
 the extent copyright law protected them. Its protection, that is, did
 not end at the line that copyright law drew. The DMCA regulated devices
 that were designed to circumvent copyright protection measures. It was
 designed to ban those devices, whether or not the use of the
 copyrighted material made possible by that circumvention would have
 been a copyright violation.</p>
<p>Aibopet.com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack circumvented a
 copyright protection system for the purpose of enabling the dog to
 dance jazz. That enablement no doubt involved the use of copyrighted
 material. But as aibopet.com’s site was noncommercial, and the use did
 not enable subsequent copyright infringements, there’s no doubt that
 aibopet.com’s hack was fair use of Sony’s copyrighted material. Yet
 fair use is not a defense to the DMCA. The question is not whether the
 use of the copyrighted material was a copyright violation. The question
 is whether a copyright protection system was circumvented.</p>
<p>The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed the
 same line of reasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a
 copyright protection system could be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer
 suggested, Felten himself was distributing a circumvention technology.
 Thus, even though he was not himself infringing anyone’s copyright, his
 academic paper was enabling others to infringe others’ copyright.</p>
<p>The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon drawn in
 1981 by Paul Conrad. At that time, a court in California had held that
 the VCR could be banned because it was a copyright-infringing
 technology: It enabled consumers to copy films without the permission
 of the copyright owner. No doubt there were uses of the technology that
 were legal: Fred Rogers, aka “Mr. Rogers,” for example, had testified
 in that case that he wanted people to feel free to tape <i>Mr. Rogers’
 Neighborhood.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the
 “Neighborhood” at hours when some children cannot use it. I think that
 it’s a real service to families to be able to record such programs and
 show them at appropriate times. I have always felt that with the advent
 of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the
 “Neighborhood” off-the-air, and I’m speaking for the “Neighborhood”
 because that’s what I produce, that they then become much more active
 in the programming of their family’s television life. Very frankly, I
 am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in
 broadcasting has always been “You are an important person just the way
 you are. You can make healthy decisions.” Maybe I’m going on too long,
 but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in
 the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.23"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even though there were uses that were legal, because there were some
 uses that were illegal, the court held the companies producing the VCR
 responsible.</p>
<p>This led Conrad to draw the cartoon below, which we can adopt to the
 DMCA.</p>
<p>No argument I have can top this picture, but let me try to get close.
 The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright
 circumvention technologies. Circumvention technologies can be used for
 different ends. They can be used, for example, to enable massive
 pirating of copyrighted material—a bad end. Or they can be used to
 enable the use of particular copyrighted materials in ways that would
 be considered fair use—a good end.</p>
<p>A handgun can be used to shoot a police officer or a child. Most
 would agree such a use is bad. Or a handgun can be used for target
 practice or to protect against an intruder. At least some would say
 that such a use would be good. It, too, is a technology that has both
 good and bad uses.</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture16.jpg" alt='cartoon'/>

<p>The obvious point of Conrad’s cartoon is the weirdness of a world
 where guns are legal, despite the harm they can do, while VCRs (and
 circumvention technologies) are illegal. Flash: <i>No one ever died
 from copyright circumvention.</i> Yet the law bans circumvention
 technologies absolutely, despite the potential that they might do some
 good, but permits guns, despite the obvious and tragic harm they do.</p>
<p>The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners are
 changing the balance that copyright law grants. Using code, copyright
 owners restrict fair use; using the DMCA, they punish those who would
 attempt to evade the restrictions on fair use that they impose through
 code. Technology becomes a means by which fair use can be erased; the
 law of the DMCA backs up that erasing.</p>
<p>This is how <i>code</i> becomes <i>law.</i> The controls built into
 the technology of copy and access protection become rules the violation
 of which is also a violation of the law. In this way, the code extends
 the law—increasing its regulation, even if the subject it regulates
 (activities that would otherwise plainly constitute fair use) is beyond
 the reach of the law. Code becomes law; code extends the law; code thus
 extends the control that copyright owners effect—at least for those
 copyright holders with the lawyers who can write the nasty letters that
 Felten and aibopet.com received.</p>
<p>There is one final aspect of the interaction between architecture and
 law that contributes to the force of copyright’s regulation. This is
 the ease with which infringements of the law can be detected. For
 contrary to the rhetoric common at the birth of cyberspace that on the
 Internet, no one knows you’re a dog, increasingly, given changing
 technologies deployed on the Internet, it is easy to find the dog who
 committed a legal wrong. The technologies of the Internet are open to
 snoops as well as sharers, and the snoops are increasingly good at
 tracking down the identity of those who violate the rules.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you were part of a <i>Star Trek</i> fan club.
 You gathered every month to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of
 fan fiction about the show. One person would play Spock, another,
 Captain Kirk. The characters would begin with a plot from a real story,
 then simply continue it.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.24"/></p>
<p>Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated
 activity. No matter what happened inside your club room, you would
 never be interfered with by the copyright police. You were free in that
 space to do as you wished with this part of our culture. You were
 allowed to build on it as you wished without fear of legal control.</p>
<p>But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it generally
 available for others to join, the story would be very different. Bots
 scouring the Net for trademark and copyright infringement would quickly
 find your site. Your posting of fan fiction, depending upon the
 ownership of the series that you’re depicting, could well inspire a
 lawyer’s threat. And ignoring the lawyer’s threat would be extremely
 costly indeed. The law of copyright is extremely efficient. The
 penalties are severe, and the process is quick.</p>
<p>This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a change
 in the ease with which the law can be enforced. That change too shifts
 the law’s balance radically. It is as if your car transmitted the speed
 at which you traveled at every moment that you drove; that would be
 just one step before the state started issuing tickets based upon the
 data you transmitted. That is, in effect, what is happening here.</p>

<h2 id='ch10.7'>Market: Concentration</h2>

<p>So copyright’s duration has increased dramatically—tripled in the
 past thirty years. And copyright’s scope has increased as well—from
 regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone. And
 copyright’s reach has changed, as every action becomes a copy and hence
 presumptively regulated. And as technologists find better ways to
 control the use of content, and as copyright is increasingly enforced
 through technology, copyright’s force changes, too. Misuse is easier to
 find and easier to control. This regulation of the creative process,
 which began as a tiny regulation governing a tiny part of the market
 for creative work, has become the single most important regulator of
 creativity there is. It is a massive expansion in the scope of the
 government’s control over innovation and creativity; it would be
 totally unrecognizable to those who gave birth to copyright’s control.</p>
<p>Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if it
 weren’t for one more change that we must also consider. This is a
 change that is in some sense the most familiar, though its significance
 and scope are not well understood. It is the one that creates precisely
 the reason to be concerned about all the other changes I have
 described.</p>
<p>This is the change in the concentration and integration of the media.
 In the past twenty years, the nature of media ownership has undergone a
 radical alteration, caused by changes in legal rules governing the
 media. Before this change happened, the different forms of media were
 owned by separate media companies. Now, the media is increasingly owned
 by only a few companies. Indeed, after the changes that the FCC
 announced in June 2003, most expect that within a few years, we will
 live in a world where just three companies control more than 85 percent
 of the media.</p>
<p>These changes are of two sorts: the scope of concentration, and its
 nature.</p>
<p>Changes in scope are the easier ones to describe. As Senator John
 McCain summarized the data produced in the FCC’s review of media
 ownership, “five companies control 85 percent of our media sources.”<noteref noteid="note.chap10.25"/> The five recording labels of Universal Music Group, BMG, Sony
 Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and EMI control 84.8 percent
 of the U.S. music market.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.26"/> The “five largest cable
 companies pipe programming to 74 percent of the cable subscribers
 nationwide.”<noteref noteid="note.chap10.27"/></p>
<p>The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation, the
 nation’s largest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer than
 seventy-five stations. Today <i>one</i> company owns more than 1,200
 stations. During that period of consolidation, the total number of
 radio owners dropped by 34 percent. Today, in most markets, the two
 largest broadcasters control 74 percent of that market’s revenues.
 Overall, just four companies control 90 percent of the nation’s radio
 advertising revenues.</p>
<p>Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well. Today,
 there are six hundred fewer daily newspapers in the United States than
 there were eighty years ago, and ten companies control half of the
 nation’s circulation. There are twenty major newspaper publishers in
 the United States. The top ten film studios receive 99 percent of all
 film revenue. The ten largest cable companies account for 85 percent of
 all cable revenue. This is a market far from the free press the framers
 sought to protect. Indeed, it is a market that is quite well
 protected—by the market.</p>
<p>Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious change
 is in the nature of that concentration. As author James Fallows put it
 in a recent article about Rupert Murdoch,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Murdoch’s companies now constitute a production system unmatched in
 its integration. They supply content—Fox movies . . . Fox TV shows . .
 . Fox-controlled sports broadcasts, plus newspapers and books. They
 sell the content to the public and to advertisers—in newspapers, on
 the broadcast network, on the cable channels. And they operate the
 physical distribution system through which the content reaches the
 customers. Murdoch’s satellite systems now distribute News Corp.
 content in Europe and Asia; if Murdoch becomes DirecTV’s largest single
 owner, that system will serve the same function in the United States.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.28"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The pattern with Murdoch is the pattern of modern media. Not just
 large companies owning many radio stations, but a few companies owning
 as many outlets of media as possible. A picture describes this pattern
 better than a thousand words could do:</p>

<img class="center" src="images/freeculture17.jpg" alt='diagram'/>

<p>Does this concentration matter? Will it affect what is made, or what
 is distributed? Or is it merely a more efficient way to produce and
 distribute content?</p>
<p>My view was that concentration wouldn’t matter. I thought it was
 nothing more than a more efficient financial structure. But now, after
 reading and listening to a barrage of creators try to convince me to
 the contrary, I am beginning to change my mind.</p>
<p>Here’s a representative story that begins to suggest how this
 integration may matter.</p>
<p>In 1969, Norman Lear created a pilot for <i>All in the Family.</i> He
 took the pilot to ABC. The network didn’t like it. It was too edgy,
 they told Lear. Make it again. Lear made a second pilot, more edgy than
 the first. ABC was exasperated. You’re missing the point, they told
 Lear. We wanted less edgy, not more.</p>
<p>Rather than comply, Lear simply took the show elsewhere. CBS was
 happy to have the series; ABC could not stop Lear from walking. The
 copyrights that Lear held assured an independence from network control.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.29"/></p>
<p>The network did not control those copyrights because the law forbade
 the networks from controlling the content they syndicated. The law
 required a separation between the networks and the content producers;
 that separation would guarantee Lear freedom. And as late as 1992,
 because of these rules, the vast majority of prime time television—75
 percent of it—was “independent” of the networks.</p>
<p>In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this independence.
 After that change, the networks quickly changed the balance. In 1985,
 there were twenty-five independent television production studios; in
 2002, only five independent television studios remained. “In 1992, only
 15 percent of new series were produced for a network by a company it
 controlled. Last year, the percentage of shows produced by controlled
 companies more than quintupled to 77 percent.”</p>
<p>“In 1992, 16 new series were produced independently of conglomerate
 control, last year there was one.”<noteref noteid="note.chap10.30"/> In 2002, 75 percent of
 prime time television was owned by the networks that ran it. “In the
 ten-year period between 1992 and 2002, the number of prime time
 television hours per week produced by network studios increased over
 200%, whereas the number of prime time television hours per week
 produced by independent studios decreased 63%.”<noteref noteid="note.chap10.31"/></p>
<p>Today, another Norman Lear with another <i>All in the Family</i>
 would find that he had the choice either to make the show less edgy or
 to be fired: The content of any show developed for a network is
 increasingly owned by the network.</p>
<p>While the number of channels has increased dramatically, the
 ownership of those channels has narrowed to an ever smaller and smaller
 few. As Barry Diller said to Bill Moyers,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, if you have companies that produce, that finance, that air on
 their channel and then distribute worldwide everything that goes
 through their controlled distribution system, then what you get is
 fewer and fewer actual voices participating in the process. [We u]sed
 to have dozens and dozens of thriving independent production companies
 producing television programs. Now you have less than a handful.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.32"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This narrowing has an effect on what is produced. The product of such
 large and concentrated networks is increasingly homogenous.
 Increasingly safe. Increasingly sterile. The product of news shows from
 networks like this is increasingly tailored to the message the network
 wants to convey. This is not the communist party, though from the
 inside, it must feel a bit like the communist party. No one can
 question without risk of consequence—not necessarily banishment to
 Siberia, but punishment nonetheless. Independent, critical, different
 views are quashed. This is not the environment for a democracy.</p>
<p>Economics itself offers a parallel that explains why this integration
 affects creativity. Clay Christensen has written about the “Innovator’s
 Dilemma”: the fact that large traditional firms find it rational to
 ignore new, breakthrough technologies that compete with their core
 business. The same analysis could help explain why large, traditional
 media companies would find it rational to ignore new cultural trends.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.33"/> Lumbering giants not only don’t, but should not, sprint. Yet if
 the field is only open to the giants, there will be far too little
 sprinting.</p>
<p>I don’t think we know enough about the economics of the media market
 to say with certainty what concentration and integration will do. The
 efficiencies are important, and the effect on culture is hard to
 measure.</p>
<p>But there is a quintessentially obvious example that does strongly
 suggest the concern.</p>
<p>In addition to the copyright wars, we’re in the middle of the drug
 wars. Government policy is strongly directed against the drug cartels;
 criminal and civil courts are filled with the consequences of this
 battle.</p>
<p>Let me hereby disqualify myself from any possible appointment to any
 position in government by saying I believe this war is a profound
 mistake. I am not pro drugs. Indeed, I come from a family once wrecked
 by drugs—though the drugs that wrecked my family were all quite legal.
 I believe this war is a profound mistake because the collateral damage
 from it is so great as to make waging the war insane. When you add
 together the burdens on the criminal justice system, the desperation of
 generations of kids whose only real economic opportunities are as drug
 warriors, the queering of constitutional protections because of the
 constant surveillance this war requires, and, most profoundly, the
 total destruction of the legal systems of many South American nations
 because of the power of the local drug cartels, I find it impossible to
 believe that the marginal benefit in reduced drug consumption by
 Americans could possibly outweigh these costs.</p>
<p>You may not be convinced. That’s fine. We live in a democracy, and it
 is through votes that we are to choose policy. But to do that, we
 depend fundamentally upon the press to help inform Americans about
 these issues.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy
 launched a media campaign as part of the “war on drugs.” The campaign
 produced scores of short film clips about issues related to illegal
 drugs. In one series (the Nick and Norm series) two men are in a bar,
 discussing the idea of legalizing drugs as a way to avoid some of the
 collateral damage from the war. One advances an argument in favor of
 drug legalization. The other responds in a powerful and effective way
 against the argument of the first. In the end, the first guy changes
 his mind (hey, it’s television). The plug at the end is a damning
 attack on the pro-legalization campaign.</p>
<p>Fair enough. It’s a good ad. Not terribly misleading. It delivers its
 message well. It’s a fair and reasonable message.</p>
<p>But let’s say you think it is a wrong message, and you’d like to run
 a countercommercial. Say you want to run a series of ads that try to
 demonstrate the extraordinary collateral harm that comes from the drug
 war. Can you do it?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, these ads cost lots of money. Assume you raise the
 money. Assume a group of concerned citizens donates all the money in
 the world to help you get your message out. Can you be sure your
 message will be heard then?</p>
<p>No. You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of avoiding
 “controversial” ads. Ads sponsored by the government are deemed
 uncontroversial; ads disagreeing with the government are controversial.
 This selectivity might be thought inconsistent with the First
 Amendment, but the Supreme Court has held that stations have the right
 to choose what they run. Thus, the major channels of commercial media
 will refuse one side of a crucial debate the opportunity to present its
 case. And the courts will defend the rights of the stations to be this
 biased.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.34"/></p>
<p>I’d be happy to defend the networks’ rights, as well—if we lived in
 a media market that was truly diverse. But concentration in the media
 throws that condition into doubt. If a handful of companies control
 access to the media, and that handful of companies gets to decide which
 political positions it will allow to be promoted on its channels, then
 in an obvious and important way, concentration matters. You might like
 the positions the handful of companies selects. But you should not like
 a world in which a mere few get to decide which issues the rest of us
 get to know about.</p>

<h2 id='ch10.8'>Together</h2>

<p>There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the
 copyright warriors that the government should “protect my property.” In
 the abstract, it is obviously true and, ordinarily, totally harmless.
 No sane sort who is not an anarchist could disagree.</p>
<p>But when we see how dramatically this “property” has changed—when
 we recognize how it might now interact with both technology and markets
 to mean that the effective constraint on the liberty to cultivate our
 culture is dramatically different—the claim begins to seem less
 innocent and obvious. Given (1) the power of technology to supplement
 the law’s control, and (2) the power of concentrated markets to weaken
 the opportunity for dissent, if strictly enforcing the massively
 expanded “property” rights granted by copyright fundamentally changes
 the freedom within this culture to cultivate and build upon our past,
 then we have to ask whether this property should be redefined.</p>
<p>Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should abolish
 copyright or go back to the eighteenth century. That would be a total
 mistake, disastrous for the most important creative enterprises within
 our culture today.</p>
<p>But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture
 notwithstanding. And these massive shifts in the effective power of
 copyright regulation, tied to increased concentration of the content
 industry and resting in the hands of technology that will increasingly
 enable control over the use of culture, should drive us to consider
 whether another adjustment is called for. Not an adjustment that
 increases copyright’s power. Not an adjustment that increases its term.
 Rather, an adjustment to restore the balance that has traditionally
 defined copyright’s regulation—a weakening of that regulation, to
 strengthen creativity.</p>
<p>Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It’s not a set of
 constant commitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers and
 geeks now flout. Instead, copyright power has grown dramatically in a
 short period of time, as the technologies of distribution and creation
 have changed and as lobbyists have pushed for more control by copyright
 holders. Changes in the past in response to changes in technology
 suggest that we may well need similar changes in the future. And these
 changes have to be <i>reductions</i> in the scope of copyright, in
 response to the extraordinary increase in control that technology and
 the market enable.</p>
<p>For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a point
 that we see only after surveying the range of these changes. When you
 add together the effect of changing law, concentrated markets, and
 changing technology, together they produce an astonishing conclusion:<i>
 Never in our history have fewer had a legal right to control more of
 the development of our culture than now.</i></p>
<p>Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were
 perpetual, they affected only that precise creative work. Not when only
 publishers had the tools to publish, for the market then was much more
 diverse. Not when there were only three television networks, for even
 then, newspapers, film studios, radio stations, and publishers were
 independent of the networks. <i>Never</i> has copyright protected such
 a wide range of rights, against as broad a range of actors, for a term
 that was remotely as long. This form of regulation—a tiny regulation
 of a tiny part of the creative energy of a nation at the founding—is
 now a massive regulation of the overall creative process. Law plus
 technology plus the market now interact to turn this historically
 benign regulation into the most significant regulation of culture that
 our free society has known.<noteref noteid="note.chap10.35"/></p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>This has been</b> a long chapter. Its point can now be briefly
 stated.</p>
<p>At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial and
 noncommercial culture. In the course of this chapter, I have
 distinguished between copying a work and transforming it. We can now
 combine these two distinctions and draw a clear map of the changes that
 copyright law has undergone.</p>
<p>In 1790, the law looked like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td>&#xa0;</td>
    <td><s>PUBLISH</s></td>
    <td><s>TRANSFORM</s></td>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Commercial</td>
    <td>©</td>
    <td>Free</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Noncommercial</td>
    <td>Free</td>
    <td>Free</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>


<p>The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by
 copyright law. Nothing else was. Transformations were free. And as
 copyright attached only with registration, and only those who intended
 to benefit commercially would register, copying through publishing of
 noncommercial work was also free.</p>
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>&#xa0;</td>
      <td><s>PUBLISH</s></td>
      <td><s>TRANSFORM</s></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Commercial</td>
      <td>©</td>
      <td>©</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Noncommercial</td>
      <td>Free</td>
      <td>Free</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>Derivative works were now regulated by copyright law—if published,
 which again, given the economics of publishing at the time, means if
 offered commercially. But noncommercial publishing and transformation
 were still essentially free.</p>
<p>In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and after
 this change, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As the
 technology of copying became more prevalent, the reach of the law
 expanded. Thus by 1975, as photocopying machines became more common, we
 could say the law began to look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>&#xa0;</td>
      <td><s>PUBLISH</s></td>
      <td><s>TRANSFORM</s></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Commercial</td>
      <td>©</td>
      <td>©</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Noncommercial</td>
      <td>©/Free</td>
      <td>Free</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through, say,
 copy machines, but still much of copying outside of the commercial
 market remained free. But the consequence of the emergence of digital
 technologies, especially in the context of a digital network, means
 that the law now looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>&#xa0;</td>
<td><s>PUBLISH</s></td>
<td><s>TRANSFORM</s></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Commercial</td>
  <td>©</td>
  <td>©</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Noncommercial</td>
  <td>©</td>
  <td>©</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most
 creativity was not. The law now regulates the full range of
 creativity—commercial or not, transformative or not—with the same
 rules designed to regulate commercial publishers.</p>
<p>Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is regulation
 that does no good. So the question that we should be asking just now is
 whether extending the regulations of copyright law into each of these
 domains actually does any good.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial copying.
 But I also have no doubt that it does more harm than good when
 regulating (as it regulates just now) noncommercial copying and,
 especially, noncommercial transformation. And increasingly, for the
 reasons sketched especially in chapters 7 and 8, one might well wonder
 whether it does more harm than good for commercial transformation. More
 commercial transformative work would be created if derivative rights
 were more sharply restricted.</p>
<p>The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property. Of
 course copyright is a kind of “property,” and of course, as with any
 property, the state ought to protect it. But first impressions
 notwithstanding, historically, this property right (as with all
 property rights<noteref noteid="note.chap10.36"/>) has been crafted to balance the important
 need to give authors and artists incentives with the equally important
 need to assure access to creative work. This balance has always been
 struck in light of new technologies. And for almost half of our
 tradition, the “copyright” did not control <i>at all</i> the freedom of
 others to build upon or transform a creative work. American culture was
 born free, and for almost 180 years our country consistently protected
 a vibrant and rich free culture.</p>
<p>We achieved that free culture because our law respected important
 limits on the scope of the interests protected by “property.” The very
 birth of “copyright” as a statutory right recognized those limits, by
 granting copyright owners protection for a limited time only (the story
 of chapter 6). The tradition of “fair use” is animated by a similar
 concern that is increasingly under strain as the costs of exercising
 any fair use right become unavoidably high (the story of chapter 7).
 Adding statutory rights where markets might stifle innovation is
 another familiar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter
 8). And granting archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect,
 claims of property notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing
 the soul of a culture (chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets,
 are built with property. But the nature of the property that builds a
 free culture is very different from the extremist vision that dominates
 the debate today.</p>
<p>Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy. In
 response to a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the technologies
 of the Internet present to twentieth-century business models for
 producing and distributing culture, the law and technology are being
 transformed in a way that will undermine our tradition of free culture.
 The property right that is copyright is no longer the balanced right
 that it was, or was intended to be. The property right that is
 copyright has become unbalanced, tilted toward an extreme. The
 opportunity to create and transform becomes weakened in a world in
 which creation requires permission and creativity must check with a
 lawyer.</p>

<h2 id='ch11'>CHAPTER ELEVEN: Chimera</h2>

<p><b>In a well-known</b> short story by H. G. Wells, a mountain climber
 named Nunez trips (literally, down an ice slope) into an unknown and
 isolated valley in the Peruvian Andes.<noteref noteid="note.chap11.1"/> The valley is
 extraordinarily beautiful, with “sweet water, pasture, an even climate,
 slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an
 excellent fruit.” But the villagers are all blind. Nunez takes this as
 an opportunity. “In the Country of the Blind,” he tells himself, “the
 One-Eyed Man is King.” So he resolves to live with the villagers to
 explore life as a king.</p>
<p>Things don’t go quite as he planned. He tries to explain the idea of
 sight to the villagers. They don’t understand. He tells them they are
 “blind.” They don’t have the word <i>blind.</i> They think he’s just
 thick. Indeed, as they increasingly notice the things he can’t do (hear
 the sound of grass being stepped on, for example), they increasingly
 try to control him. He, in turn, becomes increasingly frustrated. “‘You
 don’t understand,’ he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great and
 resolute, and which broke. ‘You are blind and I can see. Leave me
 alone!’“</p>
<p>The villagers don’t leave him alone. Nor do they see (so to speak)
 the virtue of his special power. Not even the ultimate target of his
 affection, a young woman who to him seems “the most beautiful thing in
 the whole of creation,” understands the beauty of sight. Nunez’s
 description of what he sees “seemed to her the most poetical of
 fancies, and she listened to his description of the stars and the
 mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty as though it was a guilty
 indulgence.”</p>
<p>“She did not believe,” Wells tells us, and “she could only half
 understand, but she was mysteriously delighted.”</p>
<p>When Nunez announces his desire to marry his “mysteriously delighted”
 love, the father and the village object. “You see, my dear,” her father
 instructs, “he’s an idiot. He has delusions. He can’t do anything
 right.” They take Nunez to the village doctor.</p>
<p>After a careful examination, the doctor gives his opinion. “His brain
 is affected,” he reports.</p>
<p>“What affects it?” the father asks. “Those queer things that are
 called the eyes . . . are diseased . . . in such a way as to affect his
 brain.”</p>
<p>The doctor continues: “I think I may say with reasonable certainty
 that in order to cure him completely, all that we need to do is a
 simple and easy surgical operation—namely, to remove these irritant
 bodies [the eyes].”</p>
<p>“Thank Heaven for science!” says the father to the doctor. They
 inform Nunez of this condition necessary for him to be allowed his
 bride. (You’ll have to read the original to learn what happens in the
 end. I believe in free culture, but never in giving away the end of a
 story.)</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>It sometimes</b> happens that the eggs of twins fuse in the
 mother’s womb. That fusion produces a “chimera.” A chimera is a single
 creature with two sets of DNA. The DNA in the blood, for example, might
 be different from the DNA of the skin. This possibility is an underused
 plot for murder mysteries. “But the DNA shows with 100 percent
 certainty that she was not the person whose blood was at the scene. . .
 .”</p>
<p>Before I had read about chimeras, I would have said they were
 impossible. A single person can’t have two sets of DNA. The very idea
 of DNA is that it is the code of an individual. Yet in fact, not only
 can two individuals have the same set of DNA (identical twins), but one
 person can have two different sets of DNA (a chimera). Our
 understanding of a “person” should reflect this reality.</p>
<p>The more I work to understand the current struggle over copyright and
 culture, which I’ve sometimes called unfairly, and sometimes not
 unfairly enough, “the copyright wars,” the more I think we’re dealing
 with a chimera. For example, in the battle over the question “What is
 p2p file sharing?” both sides have it right, and both sides have it
 wrong. One side says, “File sharing is just like two kids taping each
 others’ records—the sort of thing we’ve been doing for the last thirty
 years without any question at all.” That’s true, at least in part. When
 I tell my best friend to try out a new CD that I’ve bought, but rather
 than just send the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that is, in all
 relevant respects, just like what every executive in every recording
 company no doubt did as a kid: sharing music.</p>
<p>But the description is also false in part. For when my p2p server is
 on a p2p network through which anyone can get access to my music, then
 sure, my friends can get access, but it stretches the meaning of
 “friends” beyond recognition to say “my ten thousand best friends” can
 get access. Whether or not sharing my music with my best friend is what
 “we have always been allowed to do,” we have not always been allowed to
 share music with “our ten thousand best friends.”</p>
<p>Likewise, when the other side says, “File sharing is just like
 walking into a Tower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking
 out with it,” that’s true, at least in part. If, after Lyle Lovett
 (finally) releases a new album, rather than buying it, I go to Kazaa
 and find a free copy to take, that is very much like stealing a copy
 from Tower.</p>
<p>But it is not quite stealing from Tower. After all, when I take a CD
 from Tower Records, Tower has one less CD to sell. And when I take a CD
 from Tower Records, I get a bit of plastic and a cover, and something
 to show on my shelves. (And, while we’re at it, we could also note that
 when I take a CD from Tower Records, the maximum fine that might be
 imposed on me, under California law, at least, is $1,000. According to
 the RIAA, by contrast, if I download a ten-song CD, I’m liable for
 $1,500,000 in damages.)</p>
<p>The point is not that it is as neither side describes. The point is
 that it is both—both as the RIAA describes it and as Kazaa describes
 it. It is a chimera. And rather than simply denying what the other side
 asserts, we need to begin to think about how we should respond to this
 chimera. What rules should govern it?</p>
<p>We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera. We
 could, with the RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be a
 felony. We could prosecute families for millions of dollars in damages
 just because file sharing occurred on a family computer. And we can get
 universities to monitor all computer traffic to make sure that no
 computer is used to commit this crime. These responses might be
 extreme, but each of them has either been proposed or actually
 implemented.<noteref noteid="note.chap11.2"/></p>
<p>Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids act
 as though we’ve responded. We could totally legalize it. Let there be
 no copyright liability, either civil or criminal, for making
 copyrighted content available on the Net. Make file sharing like
 gossip: regulated, if at all, by social norms but not by law.</p>
<p>Either response is possible. I think either would be a mistake.
 Rather than embrace one of these two extremes, we should embrace
 something that recognizes the truth in both. And while I end this book
 with a sketch of a system that does just that, my aim in the next
 chapter is to show just how awful it would be for us to adopt the
 zero-tolerance extreme. I believe <i>either</i> extreme would be worse
 than a reasonable alternative. But I believe the zero-tolerance
 solution would be the worse of the two extremes.</p>
<p>Yet zero tolerance is increasingly our government’s policy. In the
 middle of the chaos that the Internet has created, an extraordinary
 land grab is occurring. The law and technology are being shifted to
 give content holders a kind of control over our culture that they have
 never had before. And in this extremism, many an opportunity for new
 innovation and new creativity will be lost.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about the opportunities for kids to “steal” music. My
 focus instead is the commercial and cultural innovation that this war
 will also kill. We have never seen the power to innovate spread so
 broadly among our citizens, and we have just begun to see the
 innovation that this power will unleash. Yet the Internet has already
 seen the passing of one cycle of innovation around technologies to
 distribute content. The law is responsible for this passing. As the
 vice president for global public policy at one of these new innovators,
 eMusic.com, put it when criticizing the DMCA’s added protection for
 copyrighted material,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>eMusic opposes music piracy. We are a distributor of copyrighted
 material, and we want to protect those rights.</p>

<p>But building a technology fortress that locks in the clout of the
 major labels is by no means the only way to protect copyright
 interests, nor is it necessarily the best. It is simply too early to
 answer that question. Market forces operating naturally may very well
 produce a totally different industry model.</p>

<p>This is a critical point. The choices that industry sectors make with
 respect to these systems will in many ways directly shape the market
 for digital media and the manner in which digital media are
 distributed. This in turn will directly influence the options that are
 available to consumers, both in terms of the ease with which they will
 be able to access digital media and the equipment that they will
 require to do so. Poor choices made this early in the game will retard
 the growth of this market, hurting everyone’s interests.<noteref noteid="note.chap11.3"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In April 2001, eMusic.com was purchased by Vivendi Universal, one of
 “the major labels.” Its position on these matters has now changed.</p>
<p>Reversing our tradition of tolerance now will not merely quash
 piracy. It will sacrifice values that are important to this culture,
 and will kill opportunities that could be extraordinarily valuable.</p>

</page-sequence>
<page-sequence>

<h2 id='ch12'>CHAPTER TWELVE: Harms</h2>

<p><b>To fight</b> “piracy,” to protect “property,” the content industry
 has launched a war. Lobbying and lots of campaign contributions have
 now brought the government into this war. As with any war, this one
 will have both direct and collateral damage. As with any war of
 prohibition, these damages will be suffered most by our own people.</p>
<p>My aim so far has been to describe the consequences of this war, in
 particular, the consequences for “free culture.” But my aim now is to
 extend this description of consequences into an argument. Is this war
 justified?</p>
<p>In my view, it is not. There is no good reason why this time, for the
 first time, the law should defend the old against the new, just when
 the power of the property called “intellectual property” is at its
 greatest in our history.</p>
<p>Yet “common sense” does not see it this way. Common sense is still on
 the side of the Causbys and the content industry. The extreme claims of
 control in the name of property still resonate; the uncritical
 rejection of “piracy” still has play.</p>
<p>There will be many consequences of continuing this war. I want to
 describe just three. All three might be said to be unintended. I am
 quite confident the third is unintended. I’m less sure about the first
 two. The first two protect modern RCAs, but there is no Howard
 Armstrong in the wings to fight today’s monopolists of culture.</p>

<h2 id='ch12.1'>Constraining Creators</h2>

<p>In the next ten years we will see an explosion of digital
 technologies. These technologies will enable almost anyone to capture
 and share content. Capturing and sharing content, of course, is what
 humans have done since the dawn of man. It is how we learn and
 communicate. But capturing and sharing through digital technology is
 different. The fidelity and power are different. You could send an
 e-mail telling someone about a joke you saw on Comedy Central, or you
 could send the clip. You could write an essay about the inconsistencies
 in the arguments of the politician you most love to hate, or you could
 make a short film that puts statement against statement. You could
 write a poem to express your love, or you could weave together a
 string—a mash-up—of songs from your favorite artists in a collage
 and make it available on the Net.</p>
<p>This digital “capturing and sharing” is in part an extension of the
 capturing and sharing that has always been integral to our culture, and
 in part it is something new. It is continuous with the Kodak, but it
 explodes the boundaries of Kodak-like technologies. The technology of
 digital “capturing and sharing” promises a world of extraordinarily
 diverse creativity that can be easily and broadly shared. And as that
 creativity is applied to democracy, it will enable a broad range of
 citizens to use technology to express and criticize and contribute to
 the culture all around.</p>
<p>Technology has thus given us an opportunity to do something with
 culture that has only ever been possible for individuals in small
 groups, isolated from others. Think about an old man telling a story to
 a collection of neighbors in a small town. Now imagine that same
 storytelling extended across the globe.</p>
<p>Yet all this is possible only if the activity is presumptively legal.
 In the current regime of legal regulation, it is not. Forget file
 sharing for a moment. Think about your favorite amazing sites on the
 Net. Web sites that offer plot summaries from forgotten television
 shows; sites that catalog cartoons from the 1960s; sites that mix
 images and sound to criticize politicians or businesses; sites that
 gather newspaper articles on remote topics of science or culture. There
 is a vast amount of creative work spread across the Internet. But as
 the law is currently crafted, this work is presumptively illegal.</p>
<p>That presumption will increasingly chill creativity, as the examples
 of extreme penalties for vague infringements continue to proliferate.
 It is impossible to get a clear sense of what’s allowed and what’s not,
 and at the same time, the penalties for crossing the line are
 astonishingly harsh. The four students who were threatened by the RIAA
 ( Jesse Jordan of chapter 3 was just one) were threatened with a $98
 billion lawsuit for building search engines that permitted songs to be
 copied. Yet WorldCom—which defrauded investors of $11 billion,
 resulting in a loss to investors in market capitalization of over $200
 billion—received a fine of a mere $750 million.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.1"/> And under
 legislation being pushed in Congress right now, a doctor who
 negligently removes the wrong leg in an operation would be liable for
 no more than $250,000 in damages for pain and suffering.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.2"/>
 Can common sense recognize the absurdity in a world where the maximum
 fine for downloading two songs off the Internet is more than the fine
 for a doctor’s negligently butchering a patient?</p>
<p>The consequence of this legal uncertainty, tied to these extremely
 high penalties, is that an extraordinary amount of creativity will
 either never be exercised, or never be exercised in the open. We drive
 this creative process underground by branding the modern-day Walt
 Disneys “pirates.” We make it impossible for businesses to rely upon a
 public domain, because the boundaries of the public domain are designed
 to be unclear. It never pays to do anything except pay for the right to
 create, and hence only those who can pay are allowed to create. As was
 the case in the Soviet Union, though for very different reasons, we
 will begin to see a world of underground art—not because the message
 is necessarily political, or because the subject is controversial, but
 because the very act of creating the art is legally fraught. Already,
 exhibits of “illegal art” tour the United States.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.3"/> In what
 does their “illegality” consist? In the act of mixing the culture
 around us with an expression that is critical or reflective.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this fear of illegality has to do with the
 changing law. I described that change in detail in chapter 10. But an
 even bigger part has to do with the increasing ease with which
 infractions can be tracked. As users of file-sharing systems discovered
 in 2002, it is a trivial matter for copyright owners to get courts to
 order Internet service providers to reveal who has what content. It is
 as if your cassette tape player transmitted a list of the songs that
 you played in the privacy of your own home that anyone could tune into
 for whatever reason they chose.</p>
<p>Never in our history has a painter had to worry about whether his
 painting infringed on someone else’s work; but the modern-day painter,
 using the tools of Photoshop, sharing content on the Web, must worry
 all the time. Images are all around, but the only safe images to use in
 the act of creation are those purchased from Corbis or another image
 farm. And in purchasing, censoring happens. There is a free market in
 pencils; we needn’t worry about its effect on creativity. But there is
 a highly regulated, monopolized market in cultural icons; the right to
 cultivate and transform them is not similarly free.</p>
<p>Lawyers rarely see this because lawyers are rarely empirical. As I
 described in chapter 7, in response to the story about documentary
 filmmaker Jon Else, I have been lectured again and again by lawyers who
 insist Else’s use was fair use, and hence I am wrong to say that the
 law regulates such a use.</p>
<p>But fair use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer to
 defend your right to create. And as lawyers love to forget, our system
 for defending rights such as fair use is astonishingly bad—in
 practically every context, but especially here. It costs too much, it
 delivers too slowly, and what it delivers often has little connection
 to the justice underlying the claim. The legal system may be tolerable
 for the very rich. For everyone else, it is an embarrassment to a
 tradition that prides itself on the rule of law.</p>
<p>Judges and lawyers can tell themselves that fair use provides
 adequate “breathing room” between regulation by the law and the access
 the law should allow. But it is a measure of how out of touch our legal
 system has become that anyone actually believes this. The rules that
 publishers impose upon writers, the rules that film distributors impose
 upon filmmakers, the rules that newspapers impose upon journalists—these are the real laws governing creativity. And these rules have
 little relationship to the “law” with which judges comfort themselves.</p>
<p>For in a world that threatens $150,000 for a single willful
 infringement of a copyright, and which demands tens of thousands of
 dollars to even defend against a copyright infringement claim, and
 which would never return to the wrongfully accused defendant anything
 of the costs she suffered to defend her right to speak—in that world,
 the astonishingly broad regulations that pass under the name
 “copyright” silence speech and creativity. And in that world, it takes
 a studied blindness for people to continue to believe they live in a
 culture that is free.</p>
<p>As Jed Horovitz, the businessman behind Video Pipeline, said to me,</p>

<p>We’re losing [creative] opportunities right and left. Creative people
 are being forced not to express themselves. Thoughts are not being
 expressed. And while a lot of stuff may [still] be created, it still
 won’t get distributed. Even if the stuff gets made . . . you’re not
 going to get it distributed in the mainstream media unless you’ve got a
 little note from a lawyer saying, “This has been cleared.” You’re not
 even going to get it on PBS without that kind of permission. That’s the
 point at which they control it.</p>

<h2 id='ch12.2'>Constraining Innovators</h2>

<p>The story of the last section was a crunchy-lefty story—creativity
 quashed, artists who can’t speak, yada yada yada. Maybe that doesn’t
 get you going. Maybe you think there’s enough weird art out there, and
 enough expression that is critical of what seems to be just about
 everything. And if you think that, you might think there’s little in
 this story to worry you.</p>
<p>But there’s an aspect of this story that is not lefty in any sense.
Indeed, it is an aspect that could be written by the most extreme
pro-market ideologue. And if you’re one of these sorts (and a special
one at that, 188 pages into a book like this), then you can see this
other aspect by substituting “free market” every place I’ve spoken of
“free culture.” The point is the same, even if the interests affecting
culture are more fundamental.</p>
<p>The charge I’ve been making about the regulation of culture is the
 same charge free marketers make about regulating markets. Everyone, of
 course, concedes that some regulation of markets is necessary—at a
 minimum, we need rules of property and contract, and courts to enforce
 both. Likewise, in this culture debate, everyone concedes that at least
 some framework of copyright is also required. But both perspectives
 vehemently insist that just because some regulation is good, it doesn’t
 follow that more regulation is better. And both perspectives are
 constantly attuned to the ways in which regulation simply enables the
 powerful industries of today to protect themselves against the
 competitors of tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is the single most dramatic effect of the shift in regulatory
 strategy that I described in chapter 10. The consequence of this
 massive threat of liability tied to the murky boundaries of copyright
 law is that innovators who want to innovate in this space can safely
 innovate only if they have the sign-off from last generation’s dominant
 industries. That lesson has been taught through a series of cases that
 were designed and executed to teach venture capitalists a lesson. That
 lesson—what former Napster CEO Hank Barry calls a “nuclear pall” that
 has fallen over the Valley—has been learned.</p>
<p>Consider one example to make the point, a story whose beginning I
 told in <i>The Future of Ideas</i> and which has progressed in a way
 that even I (pessimist extraordinaire) would never have predicted.</p>
<p>In 1997, Michael Roberts launched a company called MP3.com. MP3.com
 was keen to remake the music business. Their goal was not just to
 facilitate new ways to get access to content. Their goal was also to
 facilitate new ways to create content. Unlike the major labels, MP3.com
 offered creators a venue to distribute their creativity, without
 demanding an exclusive engagement from the creators.</p>
<p>To make this system work, however, MP3.com needed a reliable way to
 recommend music to its users. The idea behind this alternative was to
 leverage the revealed preferences of music listeners to recommend new
 artists. If you like Lyle Lovett, you’re likely to enjoy Bonnie Raitt.
 And so on.</p>
<p>This idea required a simple way to gather data about user
 preferences. MP3.com came up with an extraordinarily clever way to
 gather this preference data. In January 2000, the company launched a
 service called my.mp3.com. Using software provided by MP3.com, a user
 would sign into an account and then insert into her computer a CD. The
 software would identify the CD, and then give the user access to that
 content. So, for example, if you inserted a CD by Jill Sobule, then
 wherever you were—at work or at home—you could get access to that
 music once you signed into your account. The system was therefore a
 kind of music-lockbox.</p>
<p>No doubt some could use this system to illegally copy content. But
 that opportunity existed with or without MP3.com. The aim of the
 my.mp3.com service was to give users access to their own content, and
 as a by-product, by seeing the content they already owned, to discover
 the kind of content the users liked.</p>
<p>To make this system function, however, MP3.com needed to copy 50,000
 CDs to a server. (In principle, it could have been the user who
 uploaded the music, but that would have taken a great deal of time, and
 would have produced a product of questionable quality.) It therefore
 purchased 50,000 CDs from a store, and started the process of making
 copies of those CDs. Again, it would not serve the content from those
 copies to anyone except those who authenticated that they had a copy of
 the CD they wanted to access. So while this was 50,000 copies, it was
 50,000 copies directed at giving customers something they had already
 bought.</p>
<p>Nine days after MP3.com launched its service, the five major labels,
 headed by the RIAA, brought a lawsuit against MP3.com. MP3.com settled
 with four of the five. Nine months later, a federal judge found MP3.com
 to have been guilty of willful infringement with respect to the fifth.
 Applying the law as it is, the judge imposed a fine against MP3.com of
 $118 million. MP3.com then settled with the remaining plaintiff,
 Vivendi Universal, paying over $54 million. Vivendi purchased MP3.com
 just about a year later.</p>
<p>That part of the story I have told before. Now consider its
 conclusion. After Vivendi purchased MP3.com, Vivendi turned around and
 filed a malpractice lawsuit against the lawyers who had advised it that
 they had a good faith claim that the service they wanted to offer would
 be considered legal under copyright law. This lawsuit alleged that it
 should have been obvious that the courts would find this behavior
 illegal; therefore, this lawsuit sought to punish any lawyer who had
 dared to suggest that the law was less restrictive than the labels
 demanded.</p>
<p>The clear purpose of this lawsuit (which was settled for an
 unspecified amount shortly after the story was no longer covered in the
 press) was to send an unequivocal message to lawyers advising clients
 in this space: It is not just your clients who might suffer if the
 content industry directs its guns against them. It is also you. So
 those of you who believe the law should be less restrictive should
 realize that such a view of the law will cost you and your firm dearly.</p>
<p>This strategy is not just limited to the lawyers. In April 2003,
 Universal and EMI brought a lawsuit against Hummer Winblad, the venture
 capital firm (VC) that had funded Napster at a certain stage of its
 development, its cofounder (John Hummer), and general partner (Hank
 Barry).<noteref noteid="note.chap12.4"/> The claim here, as well, was that the VC should
 have recognized the right of the content industry to control how the
 industry should develop. They should be held personally liable for
 funding a company whose business turned out to be beyond the law. Here
 again, the aim of the lawsuit is transparent: Any VC now recognizes
 that if you fund a company whose business is not approved of by the
 dinosaurs, you are at risk not just in the marketplace, but in the
 courtroom as well. Your investment buys you not only a company, it also
 buys you a lawsuit. So extreme has the environment become that even car
 manufacturers are afraid of technologies that touch content. In an
 article in <i>Business 2.0,</i> Rafe Needleman describes a discussion
 with BMW:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I asked why, with all the storage capacity and computer power in the
 car, there was no way to play MP3 files. I was told that BMW engineers
 in Germany had rigged a new vehicle to play MP3s via the car’s built-in
 sound system, but that the company’s marketing and legal departments
 weren’t comfortable with pushing this forward for release stateside.
 Even today, no new cars are sold in the United States with bona fide
 MP3 players. . . .<noteref noteid="note.chap12.5"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the world of the mafia—filled with “your money or your life”
 offers, governed in the end not by courts but by the threats that the
 law empowers copyright holders to exercise. It is a system that will
 obviously and necessarily stifle new innovation. It is hard enough to
 start a company. It is impossibly hard if that company is constantly
 threatened by litigation.</p>
<p>The point is not that businesses should have a right to start illegal
 enterprises. The point is the definition of “illegal.” The law is a
 mess of uncertainty. We have no good way to know how it should apply to
 new technologies. Yet by reversing our tradition of judicial deference,
 and by embracing the astonishingly high penalties that copyright law
 imposes, that uncertainty now yields a reality which is far more
 conservative than is right. If the law imposed the death penalty for
 parking tickets, we’d not only have fewer parking tickets, we’d also
 have much less driving. The same principle applies to innovation. If
 innovation is constantly checked by this uncertain and unlimited
 liability, we will have much less vibrant innovation and much less
 creativity.</p>
<p>The point is directly parallel to the crunchy-lefty point about fair
 use. Whatever the “real” law is, realism about the effect of law in
 both contexts is the same. This wildly punitive system of regulation
 will systematically stifle creativity and innovation. It will protect
 some industries and some creators, but it will harm industry and
 creativity generally. Free market and free culture depend upon vibrant
 competition. Yet the effect of the law today is to stifle just this
 kind of competition. The effect is to produce an overregulated culture,
 just as the effect of too much control in the market is to produce an
 overregulated-regulated market.</p>
<p>The building of a permission culture, rather than a free culture, is
 the first important way in which the changes I have described will
 burden innovation. A permission culture means a lawyer’s culture—a
 culture in which the ability to create requires a call to your lawyer.
 Again, I am not antilawyer, at least when they’re kept in their proper
 place. I am certainly not antilaw. But our profession has lost the
 sense of its limits. And leaders in our profession have lost an
 appreciation of the high costs that our profession imposes upon others.
 The inefficiency of the law is an embarrassment to our tradition. And
 while I believe our profession should therefore do everything it can to
 make the law more efficient, it should at least do everything it can to
 limit the reach of the law where the law is not doing any good. The
 transaction costs buried within a permission culture are enough to bury
 a wide range of creativity. Someone needs to do a lot of justifying to
 justify that result.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>The uncertainty</b> of the law is one burden on innovation. There
 is a second burden that operates more directly. This is the effort by
 many in the content industry to use the law to directly regulate the
 technology of the Internet so that it better protects their content.</p>
<p>The motivation for this response is obvious. The Internet enables
the efficient spread of content. That efficiency is a feature of the
Internet’s design. But from the perspective of the content industry,
this feature is a “bug.” The efficient spread of content means that
content distributors have a harder time controlling the distribution of
content. One obvious response to this efficiency is thus to make the
Internet less efficient. If the Internet enables “piracy,” then, this
response says, we should break the kneecaps of the Internet.</p>
<p>The examples of this form of legislation are many. At the urging of
 the content industry, some in Congress have threatened legislation that
 would require computers to determine whether the content they access is
 protected or not, and to disable the spread of protected content.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.6"/>
 Congress has already launched proceedings to explore a mandatory
 “broadcast flag” that would be required on any device capable of
 transmitting digital video (i.e., a computer), and that would disable
 the copying of any content that is marked with a broadcast flag. Other
 members of Congress have proposed immunizing content providers from
 liability for technology they might deploy that would hunt down
 copyright violators and disable their machines.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.7"/></p>
<p>In one sense, these solutions seem sensible. If the problem is the
 code, why not regulate the code to remove the problem. But any
 regulation of technical infrastructure will always be tuned to the
 particular technology of the day. It will impose significant burdens
 and costs on the technology, but will likely be eclipsed by advances
 around exactly those requirements.</p>
<p>In March 2002, a broad coalition of technology companies, led by
 Intel, tried to get Congress to see the harm that such legislation
 would impose.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.8"/> Their argument was obviously not that
 copyright should not be protected. Instead, they argued, any protection
 should not do more harm than good.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>There is one</b> more obvious way in which this war has harmed innovation—again, a
 story that will be quite familiar to the free market crowd.</p>
<p>Copyright may be property, but like all property, it is also a form
 of regulation. It is a regulation that benefits some and harms others.
 When done right, it benefits creators and harms leeches. When done
 wrong, it is regulation the powerful use to defeat competitors.</p>
<p>As I described in chapter 10, despite this feature of copyright as
 regulation, and subject to important qualifications outlined by Jessica
 Litman in her book <i>Digital Copyright,</i><noteref noteid="note.chap12.9"/> overall this
 history of copyright is not bad. As chapter 10 details, when new
 technologies have come along, Congress has struck a balance to assure
 that the new is protected from the old. Compulsory, or statutory,
 licenses have been one part of that strategy. Free use (as in the case
 of the VCR) has been another.</p>
<p>But that pattern of deference to new technologies has now changed
 with the rise of the Internet. Rather than striking a balance between
 the claims of a new technology and the legitimate rights of content
 creators, both the courts and Congress have imposed legal restrictions
 that will have the effect of smothering the new to benefit the old.</p>
<p>The response by the courts has been fairly universal.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.10"/> It
 has been mirrored in the responses threatened and actually implemented
 by Congress. I won’t catalog all of those responses here.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.11"/>
 But there is one example that captures the flavor of them all. This is
 the story of the demise of Internet radio.</p>
<p>As I described in chapter 4, when a radio station plays a song, the
 recording artist doesn’t get paid for that “radio performance” unless
 he or she is also the composer. So, for example if Marilyn Monroe had
 recorded a version of “Happy Birthday”—to memorialize her famous
 performance before President Kennedy at Madison Square Garden—then
 whenever that recording was played on the radio, the current copyright
 owners of “Happy Birthday” would get some money, whereas Marilyn Monroe
 would not.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this balance struck by Congress makes some
 sense. The justification was that radio was a kind of advertising. The
 recording artist thus benefited because by playing her music, the radio
 station was making it more likely that her records would be purchased.
 Thus, the recording artist got something, even if only indirectly.
 Probably this reasoning had less to do with the result than with the
 power of radio stations: Their lobbyists were quite good at stopping
 any efforts to get Congress to require compensation to the recording
 artists.</p>
<p>Enter Internet radio. Like regular radio, Internet radio is a
 technology to stream content from a broadcaster to a listener. The
 broadcast travels across the Internet, not across the ether of radio
 spectrum. Thus, I can “tune in” to an Internet radio station in Berlin
 while sitting in San Francisco, even though there’s no way for me to
 tune in to a regular radio station much beyond the San Francisco
 metropolitan area.</p>
<p>This feature of the architecture of Internet radio means that there
 are potentially an unlimited number of radio stations that a user could
 tune in to using her computer, whereas under the existing architecture
 for broadcast radio, there is an obvious limit to the number of
 broadcasters and clear broadcast frequencies. Internet radio could
 therefore be more competitive than regular radio; it could provide a
 wider range of selections. And because the potential audience for
 Internet radio is the whole world, niche stations could easily develop
 and market their content to a relatively large number of users
 worldwide. According to some estimates, more than eighty million users
 worldwide have tuned in to this new form of radio.</p>
<p>Internet radio is thus to radio what FM was to AM. It is an
 improvement potentially vastly more significant than the FM improvement
 over AM, since not only is the technology better, so, too, is the
 competition. Indeed, there is a direct parallel between the fight to
 establish FM radio and the fight to protect Internet radio. As one
 author describes Howard Armstrong’s struggle to enable FM radio,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An almost unlimited number of FM stations was possible in the
 shortwaves, thus ending the unnatural restrictions imposed on radio in
 the crowded longwaves. If FM were freely developed, the number of
 stations would be limited only by economics and competition rather than
 by technical restrictions. . . . Armstrong likened the situation that
 had grown up in radio to that following the invention of the printing
 press, when governments and ruling interests attempted to control this
 new instrument of mass communications by imposing restrictive licenses
 on it. This tyranny was broken only when it became possible for men
 freely to acquire printing presses and freely to run them. FM in this
 sense was as great an invention as the printing presses, for it gave
 radio the opportunity to strike off its shackles.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.12"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This potential for FM radio was never realized—not because Armstrong
 was wrong about the technology, but because he underestimated the power
 of “vested interests, habits, customs and legislation”<noteref noteid="note.chap12.13"/> to
 retard the growth of this competing technology.</p>
<p>Now the very same claim could be made about Internet radio. For
 again, there is no technical limitation that could restrict the number
 of Internet radio stations. The only restrictions on Internet radio are
 those imposed by the law. Copyright law is one such law. So the first
 question we should ask is, what copyright rules would govern Internet
 radio?</p>
<p>But here the power of the lobbyists is reversed. Internet radio is a
 new industry. The recording artists, on the other hand, have a very
 powerful lobby, the RIAA. Thus when Congress considered the phenomenon
 of Internet radio in 1995, the lobbyists had primed Congress to adopt a
 different rule for Internet radio than the rule that applies to
 terrestrial radio. While terrestrial radio does not have to pay our
 hypothetical Marilyn Monroe when it plays her hypothetical recording of
 “Happy Birthday” on the air, <i>Internet radio does.</i> Not only is
 the law not neutral toward Internet radio—the law actually burdens
 Internet radio more than it burdens terrestrial radio.</p>
<p>This financial burden is not slight. As Harvard law professor William
 Fisher estimates, if an Internet radio station distributed adfree
 popular music to (on average) ten thousand listeners, twenty-four hours
 a day, the total artist fees that radio station would owe would be over
 $1 million a year.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.14"/> A regular radio station broadcasting
 the same content would pay no equivalent fee.</p>
<p>The burden is not financial only. Under the original rules that were
 proposed, an Internet radio station (but not a terrestrial radio
 station) would have to collect the following data from <i>every
 listening transaction:</i></p>
<p>1. name of the service;</p>
<p>2. channel of the program (AM/FM stations use station ID);</p>
<p>3. type of program (archived/looped/live);</p>
<p>4. date of transmission;</p>
<p>5. time of transmission;</p>
<p>6. time zone of origination of transmission;</p>
<p>7. numeric designation of the place of the sound recording within the
 program;</p>
<p>8. duration of transmission (to nearest second);</p>
<p>9. sound recording title;</p>
<p>10. ISRC code of the recording;</p>
<p>11. release year of the album per copyright notice and in the case of
 compilation albums, the release year of the album and copyright date of
 the track;</p>
<p>12. featured recording artist;</p>
<p>13. retail album title;</p>
<p>14. recording label;</p>
<p>15. UPC code of the retail album;</p>
<p>16. catalog number;</p>
<p>17. copyright owner information;</p>
<p>18. musical genre of the channel or program (station format);</p>
<p>19. name of the service or entity;</p>
<p>20. channel or program;</p>
<p>21. date and time that the user logged in (in the user’s time zone);</p>
<p>22. date and time that the user logged out (in the user’s time zone);</p>
<p>23. time zone where the signal was received (user);</p>
<p>24. Unique User identifier;</p>
<p>25. the country in which the user received the transmissions.</p>
<p>The Librarian of Congress eventually suspended these reporting requirements, pending further study. And he also changed the original rates set by the arbitration panel charged with setting rates. But the basic difference between Internet radio and terrestrial radio remains: Internet radio has to pay a <i>type of copyright fee</i> that terrestrial radio does not.</p>
<p>Why? What justifies this difference? Was there any study of the economic consequences from Internet radio that would justify these differences? Was the motive to protect artists against piracy?</p>
<p>In a rare bit of candor, one RIAA expert admitted what seemed obvious to everyone at the time. As Alex Alben, vice president for Public Policy at Real Networks, told me,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The RIAA, which was representing the record labels, presented some
 testimony about what they thought a willing buyer would pay to a
 willing seller, and it was much higher. It was ten times higher than
 what radio stations pay to perform the same songs for the same period
 of time. And so the attorneys representing the webcasters asked the
 RIAA, . . . “How do you come up with a rate that’s so much higher? Why
 is it worth more than radio? Because here we have hundreds of thousands
 of webcasters who want to pay, and that should establish the market
 rate, and if you set the rate so high, you’re going to drive the small
 webcasters out of business. . . .”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the RIAA experts said, “Well, we don’t really model this as an
 industry with thousands of webcasters, <i>we think it should be an
 industry with, you know, five or seven big players who can pay a high
 rate and it’s a stable, predictable market</i>.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>Translation: The aim is to use the law to eliminate competition, so
 that this platform of potentially immense competition, which would
 cause the diversity and range of content available to explode, would
 not cause pain to the dinosaurs of old. There is no one, on either the
 right or the left, who should endorse this use of the law. And yet
 there is practically no one, on either the right or the left, who is
 doing anything effective to prevent it.</p>

<h2 id='ch12.3'>Corrupting Citizens</h2>

<p>Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It gives
 dinosaurs a veto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary
 opportunity for a democratic creativity that digital technology
 enables.</p>
<p>In addition to these important harms, there is one more that was
 important to our forebears, but seems forgotten today. Overregulation
 corrupts citizens and weakens the rule of law.</p>
<p>The war that is being waged today is a war of prohibition. As with
 every war of prohibition, it is targeted against the behavior of a very
 large number of citizens. According to <i>The New York Times,</i> 43
 million Americans downloaded music in May 2002.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.15"/> According
 to the RIAA, the behavior of those 43 million Americans is a felony. We
 thus have a set of rules that transform 20 percent of America into
 criminals. As the RIAA launches lawsuits against not only the Napsters
 and Kazaas of the world, but against students building search engines,
 and increasingly against ordinary users downloading content, the
 technologies for sharing will advance to further protect and hide
 illegal use. It is an arms race or a civil war, with the extremes of
 one side inviting a more extreme response by the other.</p>
<p>The content industry’s tactics exploit the failings of the American
 legal system. When the RIAA brought suit against Jesse Jordan, it knew
 that in Jordan it had found a scapegoat, not a defendant. The threat of
 having to pay either all the money in the world in damages
 ($15,000,000) or almost all the money in the world to defend against
 paying all the money in the world in damages ($250,000 in legal fees)
 led Jordan to choose to pay all the money he had in the world ($12,000)
 to make the suit go away. The same strategy animates the RIAA’s suits
 against individual users. In September 2003, the RIAA sued 261
 individuals—including a twelve-year-old girl living in public housing
 and a seventy-year-old man who had no idea what file sharing was.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.16"/> As these scapegoats discovered, it will always cost more to
 defend against these suits than it would cost to simply settle. (The
 twelve year old, for example, like Jesse Jordan, paid her life savings
 of $2,000 to settle the case.) Our law is an awful system for defending
 rights. It is an embarrassment to our tradition. And the consequence of
 our law as it is, is that those with the power can use the law to quash
 any rights they oppose.</p>
<p>Wars of prohibition are nothing new in America. This one is just
 something more extreme than anything we’ve seen before. We experimented
 with alcohol prohibition, at a time when the per capita consumption of
 alcohol was 1.5 gallons per capita per year. The war against drinking
 initially reduced that consumption to just 30 percent of its
 preprohibition levels, but by the end of prohibition, consumption was
 up to 70 percent of the preprohibition level. Americans were drinking
 just about as much, but now, a vast number were criminals.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.17"/>
 We have launched a war on drugs aimed at reducing the consumption of
 regulated narcotics that 7 percent (or 16 million) Americans now use.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.18"/> That is a drop from the high (so to speak) in 1979 of 14
 percent of the population. We regulate automobiles to the point where
 the vast majority of Americans violate the law every day. We run such a
 complex tax system that a majority of cash businesses regularly cheat.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.19"/> We pride ourselves on our “free society,” but an endless array
 of ordinary behavior is regulated within our society. And as a result,
 a huge proportion of Americans regularly violate at least some law.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is not without consequence. It is a
 particularly salient issue for teachers like me, whose job it is to
 teach law students about the importance of “ethics.” As my colleague
 Charlie Nesson told a class at Stanford, each year law schools admit
 thousands of students who have illegally downloaded music, illegally
 consumed alcohol and sometimes drugs, illegally worked without paying
 taxes, illegally driven cars. These are kids for whom behaving
 illegally is increasingly the norm. And then we, as law professors, are
 supposed to teach them how to behave ethically—how to say no to
 bribes, or keep client funds separate, or honor a demand to disclose a
 document that will mean that your case is over. Generations of
 Americans—more significantly in some parts of America than in others,
 but still, everywhere in America today—can’t live their lives both
 normally and legally, since “normally” entails a certain degree of
 illegality.</p>
<p>The response to this general illegality is either to enforce the law
 more severely or to change the law. We, as a society, have to learn how
 to make that choice more rationally. Whether a law makes sense depends,
 in part, at least, upon whether the costs of the law, both intended and
 collateral, outweigh the benefits. If the costs, intended and
 collateral, do outweigh the benefits, then the law ought to be changed.
 Alternatively, if the costs of the existing system are much greater
 than the costs of an alternative, then we have a good reason to
 consider the alternative.</p>
<p>My point is not the idiotic one: Just because people violate a law,
 we should therefore repeal it. Obviously, we could reduce murder
 statistics dramatically by legalizing murder on Wednesdays and Fridays.
 But that wouldn’t make any sense, since murder is wrong every day of
 the week. A society is right to ban murder always and everywhere.</p>
<p>My point is instead one that democracies understood for generations,
 but that we recently have learned to forget. The rule of law depends
 upon people obeying the law. The more often, and more repeatedly, we as
 citizens experience violating the law, the less we respect the law.
 Obviously, in most cases, the important issue is the law, not respect
 for the law. I don’t care whether the rapist respects the law or not; I
 want to catch and incarcerate the rapist. But I do care whether my
 students respect the law. And I do care if the rules of law sow
 increasing disrespect because of the extreme of regulation they impose.
 Twenty million Americans have come of age since the Internet introduced
 this different idea of “sharing.” We need to be able to call these
 twenty million Americans “citizens,” not “felons.”</p>
<p>When at least forty-three million citizens download content from the
 Internet, and when they use tools to combine that content in ways
 unauthorized by copyright holders, the first question we should be
 asking is not how best to involve the FBI. The first question should be
 whether this particular prohibition is really necessary in order to
 achieve the proper ends that copyright law serves. Is there another way
 to assure that artists get paid without transforming forty-three
 million Americans into felons? Does it make sense if there are other
 ways to assure that artists get paid without transforming America into
 a nation of felons?</p>
<p>This abstract point can be made more clear with a particular example.
 We all own CDs. Many of us still own phonograph records. These pieces
 of plastic encode music that in a certain sense we have bought. The law
 protects our right to buy and sell that plastic: It is not a copyright
 infringement for me to sell all my classical records at a used record
 store and buy jazz records to replace them. That “use” of the
 recordings is free.</p>
<p>But as the MP3 craze has demonstrated, there is another use of
 phonograph records that is effectively free. Because these recordings
 were made without copy-protection technologies, I am “free” to copy, or
 “rip,” music from my records onto a computer hard disk. Indeed, Apple
 Corporation went so far as to suggest that “freedom” was a right: In a
 series of commercials, Apple endorsed the “Rip, Mix, Burn” capacities
 of digital technologies.</p>
<p>This “use” of my records is certainly valuable. I have begun a large
 process at home of ripping all of my and my wife’s CDs, and storing
 them in one archive. Then, using Apple’s iTunes, or a wonderful program
 called Andromeda, we can build different play lists of our music: Bach,
 Baroque, Love Songs, Love Songs of Significant Others—the potential is
 endless. And by reducing the costs of mixing play lists, these
 technologies help build a creativity with play lists that is itself
 independently valuable. Compilations of songs are creative and
 meaningful in their own right.</p>
<p>This use is enabled by unprotected media—either CDs or records. But
 unprotected media also enable file sharing. File sharing threatens (or
 so the content industry believes) the ability of creators to earn a
 fair return from their creativity. And thus, many are beginning to
 experiment with technologies to eliminate unprotected media. These
 technologies, for example, would enable CDs that could not be ripped.
 Or they might enable spy programs to identify ripped content on
 people’s machines.</p>
<p>If these technologies took off, then the building of large archives
 of your own music would become quite difficult. You might hang in
 hacker circles, and get technology to disable the technologies that
 protect the content. Trading in those technologies is illegal, but
 maybe that doesn’t bother you much. In any case, for the vast majority
 of people, these protection technologies would effectively destroy the
 archiving use of CDs. The technology, in other words, would force us
 all back to the world where we either listened to music by manipulating
 pieces of plastic or were part of a massively complex “digital rights
 management” system.</p>
<p>If the only way to assure that artists get paid were the elimination
 of the ability to freely move content, then these technologies to
 interfere with the freedom to move content would be justifiable. But
 what if there were another way to assure that artists are paid, without
 locking down any content? What if, in other words, a different system
 could assure compensation to artists while also preserving the freedom
 to move content easily?</p>
<p>My point just now is not to prove that there is such a system. I
 offer a version of such a system in the last chapter of this book. For
 now, the only point is the relatively uncontroversial one: If a
 different system achieved the same legitimate objectives that the
 existing copyright system achieved, but left consumers and creators
 much more free, then we’d have a very good reason to pursue this
 alternative—namely, freedom. The choice, in other words, would not be
 between property and piracy; the choice would be between different
 property systems and the freedoms each allowed.</p>
<p>I believe there is a way to assure that artists are paid without
 turning forty-three million Americans into felons. But the salient
 feature of this alternative is that it would lead to a very different
 market for producing and distributing creativity. The dominant few, who
 today control the vast majority of the distribution of content in the
 world, would no longer exercise this extreme of control. Rather, they
 would go the way of the horse-drawn buggy.</p>
<p>Except that this generation’s buggy manufacturers have already
 saddled Congress, and are riding the law to protect themselves against
 this new form of competition. For them the choice is between forty-three million Americans as criminals and their own survival.</p>
<p>It is understandable why they choose as they do. It is not
 understandable why we as a democracy continue to choose as we do. Jack
 Valenti is charming; but not so charming as to justify giving up a
 tradition as deep and important as our tradition of free culture.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>There’s one more</b> aspect to this corruption that is
 particularly important to civil liberties, and follows directly from
 any war of prohibition. As Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Fred
 von Lohmann describes, this is the “collateral damage” that “arises
 whenever you turn a very large percentage of the population into
 criminals.” This is the collateral damage to civil liberties generally.</p>
<p>“If you can treat someone as a putative lawbreaker,” von Lohmann
 explains,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then all of a sudden a lot of basic civil liberty protections
 evaporate to one degree or another. . . . If you’re a copyright
 infringer, how can you hope to have any privacy rights? If you’re a
 copyright infringer, how can you hope to be secure against seizures of
 your computer? How can you hope to continue to receive Internet access?
 . . . Our sensibilities change as soon as we think, “Oh, well, but that
 person’s a criminal, a lawbreaker.” Well, what this campaign against
 file sharing has done is turn a remarkable percentage of the American
 Internet-using population into “law-breakers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the consequence of this transformation of the American public
 into criminals is that it becomes trivial, as a matter of due process,
 to effectively erase much of the privacy most would presume.</p>
<p>Users of the Internet began to see this generally in 2003 as the RIAA
 launched its campaign to force Internet service providers to turn over
 the names of customers who the RIAA believed were violating copyright
 law. Verizon fought that demand and lost. With a simple request to a
 judge, and without any notice to the customer at all, the identity of
 an Internet user is revealed.</p>
<p>The RIAA then expanded this campaign, by announcing a general
 strategy to sue individual users of the Internet who are alleged to
 have downloaded copyrighted music from file-sharing systems. But as
 we’ve seen, the potential damages from these suits are astronomical: If
 a family’s computer is used to download a single CD’s worth of music,
 the family could be liable for $2 million in damages. That didn’t stop
 the RIAA from suing a number of these families, just as they had sued
 Jesse Jordan.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.20"/></p>
<p>Even this understates the espionage that is being waged by the RIAA.
 A report from CNN late last summer described a strategy the RIAA had
 adopted to track Napster users.<noteref noteid="note.chap12.21"/> Using a sophisticated
 hashing algorithm, the RIAA took what is in effect a fingerprint of
 every song in the Napster catalog. Any copy of one of those MP3s will
 have the same “fingerprint.”</p>
<p>So imagine the following not-implausible scenario: Imagine a friend
 gives a CD to your daughter—a collection of songs just like the
 cassettes you used to make as a kid. You don’t know, and neither does
 your daughter, where these songs came from. But she copies these songs
 onto her computer. She then takes her computer to college and connects
 it to a college network, and if the college network is “cooperating”
 with the RIAA’s espionage, and she hasn’t properly protected her
 content from the network (do you know how to do that yourself ?), then
 the RIAA will be able to identify your daughter as a “criminal.” And
 under the rules that universities are beginning to deploy,<noteref noteid="note.chap12.22"/>
 your daughter can lose the right to use the university’s computer
 network. She can, in some cases, be expelled.</p>
<p>Now, of course, she’ll have the right to defend herself. You can hire
 a lawyer for her (at $300 per hour, if you’re lucky), and she can plead
 that she didn’t know anything about the source of the songs or that
 they came from Napster. And it may well be that the university believes
 her. But the university might not believe her. It might treat this
 “contraband” as presumptive of guilt. And as any number of college
 students have already learned, our presumptions about innocence
 disappear in the middle of wars of prohibition. This war is no
 different.</p>
<p>Says von Lohmann,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So when we’re talking about numbers like forty to sixty million
 Americans that are essentially copyright infringers, you create a
 situation where the civil liberties of those people are very much in
 peril in a general matter. [I don’t] think [there is any] analog where
 you could randomly choose any person off the street and be confident
 that they were committing an unlawful act that could put them on the
 hook for potential felony liability or hundreds of millions of dollars
 of civil liability. Certainly we all speed, but speeding isn’t the kind
 of an act for which we routinely forfeit civil liberties. Some people
 use drugs, and I think that’s the closest analog, [but] many have noted
 that the war against drugs has eroded all of our civil liberties
 because it’s treated so many Americans as criminals. Well, I think it’s
 fair to say that file sharing is an order of magnitude larger number of
 Americans than drug use. . . . If forty to sixty million Americans have
 become lawbreakers, then we’re really on a slippery slope to lose a lot
 of civil liberties for all forty to sixty million of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When forty to sixty million Americans are considered “criminals”
 under the law, and when the law could achieve the same objective—securing rights to authors—without these millions being considered
 “criminals,” who is the villain? Americans or the law? Which is
 American, a constant war on our own people or a concerted effort
 through our democracy to change our law?</p>

<p>So here’s the picture: You’re standing at the side of the road. Your
 car is on fire. You are angry and upset because in part you helped
 start the fire. Now you don’t know how to put it out. Next to you is a
 bucket, filled with gasoline. Obviously, gasoline won’t put the fire
 out.</p>
<p>As you ponder the mess, someone else comes along. In a panic, she
 grabs the bucket. Before you have a chance to tell her to stop—or
 before she understands just why she should stop—the bucket is in the
 air. The gasoline is about to hit the blazing car. And the fire that
 gasoline will ignite is about to ignite everything around.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>A war</b> about copyright rages all around—and we’re all focusing
 on the wrong thing. No doubt, current technologies threaten existing
 businesses. No doubt they may threaten artists. But technologies
 change. The industry and technologists have plenty of ways to use
 technology to protect themselves against the current threats of the
 Internet. This is a fire that if let alone would burn itself out.</p>
<p>Yet policy makers are not willing to leave this fire to itself.
 Primed with plenty of lobbyists’ money, they are keen to intervene to
 eliminate the problem they perceive. But the problem they perceive is
 not the real threat this culture faces. For while we watch this small
 fire in the corner, there is a massive change in the way culture is
 made that is happening all around.</p>
<p>Somehow we have to find a way to turn attention to this more
 important and fundamental issue. Somehow we have to find a way to avoid
 pouring gasoline onto this fire.</p>
<p>We have not found that way yet. Instead, we seem trapped in a
 simpler, binary view. However much many people push to frame this
 debate more broadly, it is the simple, binary view that remains. We
 rubberneck to look at the fire when we should be keeping our eyes on
 the road.</p>
<p>This challenge has been my life these last few years. It has also
 been my failure. In the two chapters that follow, I describe one small
 brace of efforts, so far failed, to find a way to refocus this debate.
 We must understand these failures if we’re to understand what success
 will require.</p>

<h2 id='ch13'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Eldred</h2>

<p>In 1995, a father was frustrated that his daughters didn’t seem to
 like Hawthorne. No doubt there was more than one such father, but at
 least one did something about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer
 programmer living in New Hampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the
 Web. An electronic version, Eldred thought, with links to pictures and
 explanatory text, would make this nineteenth-century author’s work come
 alive.</p>
<p>It didn’t work—at least for his daughters. They didn’t find
 Hawthorne any more interesting than before. But Eldred’s experiment
 gave birth to a hobby, and his hobby begat a cause: Eldred would build
 a library of public domain works by scanning these works and making
 them available for free.</p>
<p>Eldred’s library was not simply a copy of certain public domain
 works, though even a copy would have been of great value to people
 across the world who can’t get access to printed versions of these
 works. Instead, Eldred was producing derivative works from these public
 domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm into stories more accessible
 to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed Hawthorne, and many
 others, into a form more accessible—technically accessible—today.</p>
<p>Eldred’s freedom to do this with Hawthorne’s work grew from the same
 source as Disney’s. Hawthorne’s <i>Scarlet Letter</i> had passed into
 the public domain in 1907. It was free for anyone to take without the
 permission of the Hawthorne estate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover
 Press and Penguin Classics, take works from the public domain and
 produce printed editions, which they sell in bookstores across the
 country. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and turn them into
 animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (<i>Cinderella</i>),
 sometimes not (<i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet</i>).
 These are all commercial publications of public domain works.</p>
<p>The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications of
 public domain works. Eldred’s is just one example. There are literally
 thousands of others. Hundreds of thousands from across the world have
 discovered this platform of expression and now use it to share works
 that are, by law, free for the taking. This has produced what we might
 call the “noncommercial publishing industry,” which before the Internet
 was limited to people with large egos or with political or social
 causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range of individuals
 and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.1"/></p>
<p>As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost’s
 collection of poems <i>New Hampshire</i> was slated to pass into the
 public domain. Eldred wanted to post that collection in his free public
 library. But Congress got in the way. As I described in chapter 10, in
 1998, for the eleventh time in forty years, Congress extended the terms
 of existing copyrights—this time by twenty years. Eldred would not be
 free to add any works more recent than 1923 to his collection until
 2019. Indeed, no copyrighted work would pass into the public domain
 until that year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term
 again). By contrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents
 will pass into the public domain.</p>
<p>This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), enacted
 in memory of the congressman and former musician Sonny Bono, who, his
 widow, Mary Bono, says, believed that “copy-rights should be forever.”<noteref noteid="note.chap13.2"/></p>
<p>Eldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it
 through civil disobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced
 that he would publish as planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of
 a second law passed in 1998, the NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act
 of publishing would make Eldred a felon—whether or not anyone
 complained. This was a dangerous strategy for a disabled programmer to
 undertake.</p>
<p>It was here that I became involved in Eldred’s battle. I was a
 constitutional scholar whose first passion was constitutional
 interpretation. And though constitutional law courses never focus upon
 the Progress Clause of the Constitution, it had always struck me as
 importantly different. As you know, the Constitution says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science . . . by
 securing for limited Times to Authors . . . exclusive Right to their .
 . . Writings. . . .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I’ve described, this clause is unique within the power-granting
 clause of Article I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause
 granting power to Congress simply says Congress has the power to do
 something—for example, to regulate “commerce among the several states”
 or “declare War.” But here, the “something” is something quite
 specific—to “promote ...Progress”—through means that are also
 specific—by “securing” “exclusive Rights” (i.e., copyrights) “for
 limited Times.”</p>
<p>In the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of
 extending existing terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me about
 this was, if Congress has the power to extend existing terms, then the
 Constitution’s requirement that terms be “limited” will have no
 practical effect. If every time a copyright is about to expire,
 Congress has the power to extend its term, then Congress can achieve
 what the Constitution plainly forbids—perpetual terms “on the
 installment plan,” as Professor Peter Jaszi so nicely put it.</p>
<p>As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember
 sitting late at the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious
 consideration of the question. No one had ever challenged Congress’s
 practice of extending existing terms. That failure may in part be why
 Congress seemed so untroubled in its habit. That, and the fact that the
 practice had become so lucrative for Congress. Congress knows that
 copyright owners will be willing to pay a great deal of money to see
 their copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite happy to keep
 this gravy train going.</p>
<p>For this is the core of the corruption in our present system of
 government.”Corruption” not in the sense that representatives are
 bribed. Rather, “corruption” in the sense that the system induces the
 beneficiaries of Congress’s acts to raise and give money to Congress to
 induce it to act. There’s only so much time; there’s only so much
 Congress can do. Why not limit its actions to those things it must
 do—and those things that pay? Extending copyright terms pays.</p>
<p>If that’s not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you’re one
 of the very few lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to
 make money one hundred years after it was created. The Estate of Robert
 Frost is a good example. Frost died in 1963. His poetry continues to be
 extraordinarily valuable. Thus the Robert Frost estate benefits greatly
 from any extension of copyright, since no publisher would pay the
 estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be published by anyone
 for free.</p>
<p>So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from
 three of Frost’s poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems is
 about to expire. You sit on the board of the Robert Frost estate. Your
 financial adviser comes to your board meeting with a very grim report:</p>
<p>“Next year,” the adviser announces, “our copyrights in works A, B,
 and C will expire. That means that after next year, we will no longer
 be receiving the annual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers
 of those works.</p>
<p>“There’s a proposal in Congress, however,” she continues, “that could
 change this. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the terms
 of copyright by twenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily
 valuable to us. So we should hope this bill passes.”</p>
<p>“Hope?” a fellow board member says. “Can’t we be doing something
 about it?”</p>
<p>“Well, obviously, yes,” the adviser responds. “We could contribute to
 the campaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that they
 support the bill.”</p>
<p>You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want to
 know whether this disgusting practice is worth it. “How much would we
 get if this extension were passed?” you ask the adviser. “How much is
 it worth?”</p>
<p>“Well,” the adviser says, “if you’re confident that you will continue
 to get at least $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the
 ’discount rate’ that we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent),
 then this law would be worth $1,146,000 to the estate.”</p>
<p>You’re a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the
 correct conclusion:</p>
<p>“So you’re saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than
 $1,000,000 in campaign contributions if we were confident those
 contributions would assure that the bill was passed?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely,” the adviser responds. “It is worth it to you to
 contribute up to the ’present value’ of the income you expect from
 these copyrights. Which for us means over $1,000,000.”</p>
<p>You quickly get the point—you as the member of the board and, I
 trust, you the reader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every
 beneficiary in the position of the Robert Frost estate faces the same
 choice: If they can contribute to get a law passed to extend
 copyrights, they will benefit greatly from that extension. And so each
 time copyrights are about to expire, there is a massive amount of
 lobbying to get the copyright term extended.</p>
<p>Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legislation
 can be bought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in
 the world to buy further extensions of copyright.</p>
<p>In the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright
 Term Extension Act, this “theory” about incentives was proved real. Ten
 of the thirteen original sponsors of the act in the House received the
 maximum contribution from Disney’s political action committee; in the
 Senate, eight of the twelve sponsors received contributions.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.3"/>
 The RIAA and the MPAA are estimated to have spent over $1.5 million
 lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. They paid out more than $200,000
 in campaign contributions.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.4"/> Disney is estimated to have
 contributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in the 1998
 cycle.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.5"/></p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Constitutional law</b> is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at
 least, it need not be. So when I was considering Eldred’s complaint,
 this reality about the never-ending incentives to increase the
 copyright term was central to my thinking. In my view, a pragmatic
 court committed to interpreting and applying the Constitution of our
 framers would see that if Congress has the power to extend existing
 terms, then there would be no effective constitutional requirement that
 terms be “limited.” If they could extend it once, they would extend it
 again and again and again.</p>
<p>It was also my judgment that <i>this</i> Supreme Court would not
 allow Congress to extend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme
 Court’s work knows, this Court has increasingly restricted the power of
 Congress when it has viewed Congress’s actions as exceeding the power
 granted to it by the Constitution. Among constitutional scholars, the
 most famous example of this trend was the Supreme Court’s decision in
 1995 to strike down a law that banned the possession of guns near
 schools.</p>
<p>Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress’s granted
 powers very broadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the
 power to regulate only “commerce among the several states” (aka
 “interstate commerce”), the Supreme Court had interpreted that power to
 include the power to regulate any activity that merely affected
 interstate commerce.</p>
<p>As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there was
 no limit to Congress’s power to regulate, since just about every
 activity, when considered on a national scale, affects interstate
 commerce. A Constitution designed to limit Congress’s power was instead
 interpreted to impose no limit.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist’s command, changed
 that in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez.</i> The government had argued
 that possessing guns near schools affected interstate commerce. Guns
 near schools increase crime, crime lowers property values, and so on.
 In the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked the government whether
 there was any activity that would not affect interstate commerce under
 the reasoning the government advanced. The government said there was
 not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then
 that activity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the
 government said, was not in the position to second-guess Congress.</p>
<p>“We pause to consider the implications of the government’s
 arguments,” the Chief Justice wrote.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.6"/> If anything Congress
 says is interstate commerce must therefore be considered interstate
 commerce, then there would be no limit to Congress’s power. The
 decision in <i>Lopez</i> was reaffirmed five years later in <i>United
 States</i> v. <i>Morrison.</i><noteref noteid="note.chap13.7"/></p>
<p>If a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the
 Progress Clause as much as the Commerce Clause.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.8"/> And if it
 is applied to the Progress Clause, the principle should yield the
 conclusion that Congress can’t extend an existing term. If Congress
 could extend an existing term, then there would be no “stopping point”
 to Congress’s power over terms, though the Constitution expressly
 states that there is such a limit. Thus, the same principle applied to
 the power to grant copyrights should entail that Congress is not
 allowed to extend the term of existing copyrights.</p>

<p><i>If,</i> that is, the principle announced in <i>Lopez</i> stood for a
 principle. Many believed the decision in <i>Lopez</i> stood for
 politics—a conservative Supreme Court, which believed in states’
 rights, using its power over Congress to advance its own personal
 political preferences. But I rejected that view of the Supreme Court’s
 decision. Indeed, shortly after the decision, I wrote an article
 demonstrating the “fidelity” in such an interpretation of the
 Constitution. The idea that the Supreme Court decides cases based upon
 its politics struck me as extraordinarily boring. I was not going to
 devote my life to teaching constitutional law if these nine Justices
 were going to be petty politicians.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Now let’s pause</b> for a moment to make sure we understand what
 the argument in <i>Eldred</i> was not about. By insisting on the
 Constitution’s limits to copyright, obviously Eldred was not endorsing
 piracy. Indeed, in an obvious sense, he was fighting a kind of
 piracy—piracy of the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote his work
 and when Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term
 was just fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney
 had already enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They
 had gotten the benefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions:
 In exchange for a monopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created
 new work. But now these entities were using their power—expressed
 through the power of lobbyists’ money—to get another twenty-year
 dollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop would be taken from the
 public domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a piracy that affects us all.</p>
<p>Some people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief
 before the Supreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association wrote
 that the public domain is nothing more than “legal piracy.”<noteref noteid="note.chap13.9"/>
 But it is not piracy when the law allows it; and in our constitutional
 system, our law requires it. Some may not like the Constitution’s
 requirements, but that doesn’t make the Constitution a pirate’s
 charter.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copyright
 as a way to assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influence
 the development and distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric Eldred
 discovered, we have set up a system that assures that copyright terms
 will be repeatedly extended, and extended, and extended. We have
 created the perfect storm for the public domain. Copyrights have not
 expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be bought
 to extend them again.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>It is valuable</b> copyrights that are responsible for terms being
 extended. Mickey Mouse and “Rhapsody in Blue.” These works are too
 valuable for copyright owners to ignore. But the real harm to our
 society from copyright extensions is not that Mickey Mouse remains
 Disney’s. Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. Forget all the
 works from the 1920s and 1930s that have continuing commercial value.
 The real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The
 real harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially
 exploited, and no longer available as a result.</p>
<p>If you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to
 1942) affected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 2
 percent of that work has any continuing commercial value. It was the
 copyright holders for that 2 percent who pushed the CTEA through. But
 the law and its effect were not limited to that 2 percent. The law
 extended the terms of copyright generally.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.10"/></p>
<p>Think practically about the consequence of this
 extension—practically, as a businessperson, and not as a lawyer eager
 for more legal work. In 1930, 10,047 books were published. In 2000, 174
 of those books were still in print. Let’s say you were Brewster Kahle,
 and you wanted to make available to the world in your iArchive project
 the remaining 9,873. What would you have to do?</p>
<p>Well, first, you’d have to determine which of the 9,873 books were
 still under copyright. That requires going to a library (these data are
 not on-line) and paging through tomes of books, cross-checking the
 titles and authors of the 9,873 books with the copyright registration
 and renewal records for works published in 1930. That will produce a
 list of books still under copyright.</p>
<p>Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate
 the current copyright owners. How would you do that?</p>
<p>Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright owners
 somewhere. Practical people think this way. How could there be
 thousands and thousands of government monopolies without there being at
 least a list?</p>
<p>But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in
 1959, of the person who registered the copyright. But just think
 practically about how impossibly difficult it would be to track down
 thousands of such records—especially since the person who registered
 is not necessarily the current owner. And we’re just talking about
 1930!</p>
<p>“But there isn’t a list of who owns property generally,” the
 apologists for the system respond. “Why should there be a list of
 copyright owners?”</p>
<p>Well, actually, if you think about it, there <i>are</i> plenty of
 lists of who owns what property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles
 to cars. And where there isn’t a list, the code of real space is pretty
 good at suggesting who the owner of a bit of property is. (A swing set
 in your backyard is probably yours.) So formally or informally, we have
 a pretty good way to know who owns what tangible property.</p>
<p>So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who owns the
 house by looking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see a car,
 there is ordinarily a license plate that will link the owner to the
 car. If you see a bunch of children’s toys sitting on the front lawn of
 a house, it’s fairly easy to determine who owns the toys. And if you
 happen to see a baseball lying in a gutter on the side of the road,
 look around for a second for some kids playing ball. If you don’t see
 any kids, then okay: Here’s a bit of property whose owner we can’t
 easily determine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we
 ordinarily know quite well who owns what property.</p>
<p>Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library. The
 library owns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I’ve already
 described, there’s no list of copyright owners. There are authors’
 names, of course, but their copyrights could have been assigned, or
 passed down in an estate like Grandma’s old jewelry. To know who owns
 what, you would have to hire a private detective. The bottom line: The
 owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, in which it
 is a felony to use such property without the property owner’s
 permission, the property isn’t going to be used.</p>
<p>The consequence with respect to old books is that they won’t be
 digitized, and hence will simply rot away on shelves. But the
 consequence for other creative works is much more dire.</p>
<p>Consider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Studios,
 which owns the copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee is a
 direct beneficiary of the Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films were
 made between 1921 and 1951. Only one of these films, <i>The Lucky Dog,</i>
 is currently out of copyright. But for the CTEA, films made after 1923
 would have begun entering the public domain. Because Agee controls the
 exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great deal of
 money. According to one estimate, “Roach has sold about 60,000
 videocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo’s silent films.”<noteref noteid="note.chap13.11"/></p>
<p>Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare virtue in
 this culture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the Supreme
 Court that the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act will, if left
 standing, destroy a whole generation of American film.</p>
<p>His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has any
 continuing commercial value. The rest—to the extent it survives at
 all—sits in vaults gathering dust. It may be that some of this work
 not now commercially valuable will be deemed to be valuable by the
 owners of the vaults. For this to occur, however, the commercial
 benefit from the work must exceed the costs of making the work
 available for distribution.</p>
<p>We can’t know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs. For
 most of the history of film, the costs of restoring film were very
 high; digital technology has lowered these costs substantially. While
 it cost more than $10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white
 film in 1993, it can now cost as little as $100 to digitize one hour of
 8 mm film.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.12"/></p>
<p>Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most important.
 Lawyers, too, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In
 addition to preserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the
 rights. And to secure the rights for a film that is under copyright,
 you need to locate the copyright owner.</p>
<p>Or more accurately, <i>owners.</i> As we’ve seen, there isn’t only a
 single copyright associated with a film; there are many. There isn’t a
 single person whom you can contact about those copyrights; there are as
 many as can hold the rights, which turns out to be an extremely large
 number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights to these films is
 exceptionally high.</p>
<p>“But can’t you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the
 copyright owner when she shows up?” Sure, if you want to commit a
 felony. And even if you’re not worried about committing a felony, when
 she does show up, she’ll have the right to sue you for all the profits
 you have made. So, if you’re successful, you can be fairly confident
 you’ll be getting a call from someone’s lawyer. And if you’re not
 successful, you won’t make enough to cover the costs of your own
 lawyer. Either way, you have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too often
 the case, saying you have to talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you
 won’t make any money.</p>
<p>For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed
 these costs. But for the vast majority of them, there is no way the
 benefit would outweigh the legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of
 old films, Agee argued, the film will not be restored and distributed
 until the copyright expires.</p>
<p>But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will
 have expired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and
 nitrate stock dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal
 canisters in which they are now stored will be filled with nothing more
 than dust.</p>

<p><b>Of all the</b> creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny
 fraction has continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the
 copyright is a crucially important legal device. For that tiny
 fraction, the copyright creates incentives to produce and distribute
 the creative work. For that tiny fraction, the copyright acts as an
 “engine of free expression.”</p>
<p>But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the
 creative work has a commercial life is extremely short. As I’ve
 indicated, most books go out of print within one year. The same is true
 of music and film. Commercial culture is sharklike. It must keep
 moving. And when a creative work falls out of favor with the commercial
 distributors, the commercial life ends.</p>
<p>Yet that doesn’t mean the life of the creative work ends. We don’t
 keep libraries of books in order to compete with Barnes &amp; Noble, and we
 don’t have archives of films because we expect people to choose between
 spending Friday night watching new movies and spending Friday night
 watching a 1930 news documentary. The noncommercial life of culture is
 important and valuable—for entertainment but also, and more
 importantly, for knowledge. To understand who we are, and where we came
 from, and how we have made the mistakes that we have, we need to have
 access to this history.</p>
<p>Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression.
 In this context, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in
 this context do no good.</p>
<p>Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of
 our history, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no<i>
 copyright-related use</i> that would be inhibited by an exclusive
 right. When a book went out of print, you could not buy it from a
 publisher. But you could still buy it from a used book store, and when
 a used book store sells it, in America, at least, there is no need to
 pay the copyright owner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of a book
 after its commercial life ended was a use that was independent of
 copyright law.</p>
<p>The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring
 a film—the real economic costs, not the lawyer costs—were so high, it
 was never at all feasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains
 of a great dinner, when it’s over, it’s over. Once a film passed out of
 its commercial life, it may have been archived for a bit, but that was
 the end of its life so long as the market didn’t have more to offer.</p>
<p>In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most
 of our history, long copyrights wouldn’t have mattered for the works
 that lost their commercial value. Long copyrights for these works would
 not have interfered with anything.</p>
<p>But this situation has now changed.</p>
<p>One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital
 technologies is to enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of.
 Digital technologies now make it possible to preserve and give access
 to all sorts of knowledge. Once a book goes out of print, we can now
 imagine digitizing it and making it available to everyone, forever.
 Once a film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it and make it
 available to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give new life to
 copyrighted material after it passes out of its commercial life. It is
 now possible to preserve and assure universal access to this knowledge
 and culture, whereas before it was not.</p>
<p>And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of producing
 this digital archive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of
 copyright. To digitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires
 permission of the copyright owner. The same with music, film, or any
 other aspect of our culture protected by copyright. The effort to make
 these things available to history, or to researchers, or to those who
 just want to explore, is now inhibited by a set of rules that were
 written for a radically different context.</p>
<p>Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: Now
 that technology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, the
 law gets in the way. And it doesn’t get in the way for any useful<i>
 copyright</i> purpose, for the purpose of copyright is to enable the
 commercial market that spreads culture. No, we are talking about
 culture after it has lived its commercial life. In this context,
 copyright is serving no purpose <i>at all</i> related to the spread of
 knowledge. In this context, copyright is not an engine of free
 expression. Copyright is a brake.</p>
<p>You may well ask, “But if digital technologies lower the costs for
 Brewster Kahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too.
 So won’t Random House do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading culture
 widely?”</p>
<p>Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that
 publishers would be as complete as libraries. If Barnes &amp; Noble offered
 to lend books from its stores for a low price, would that eliminate the
 need for libraries? Only if you think that the only role of a library
 is to serve what “the market” would demand. But if you think the role
 of a library is bigger than this—if you think its role is to archive
 culture, whether there’s a demand for any particular bit of that
 culture or not—then we can’t count on the commercial market to do our
 library work for us.</p>
<p>I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We
 should rely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable
 culture. My message is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the
 market is not doing the job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the
 freedom to fill the gaps. As one researcher calculated for American
 culture, 94 percent of the films, books, and music produced between
 1923 and 1946 is not commercially available. However much you love the
 commercial market, if access is a value, then 6 percent is a failure to
 provide that value.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.13"/></p>

<p><b>In January 1999,</b> we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred’s behalf in
 federal district court in Washington, D.C., asking the court to declare
 the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act unconstitutional. The two
 central claims that we made were (1) that extending existing terms
 violated the Constitution’s “limited Times” requirement, and (2) that
 extending terms by another twenty years violated the First Amendment.</p>
<p>The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an
 argument. A panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit also
 dismissed our claims, though after hearing an extensive argument. But
 that decision at least had a dissent, by one of the most conservative
 judges on that court. That dissent gave our claims life.</p>
<p>Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that
 copyrights be for “limited Times” only. His argument was as elegant as
 it was simple: If Congress can extend existing terms, then there is no
 “stopping point” to Congress’s power under the Copyright Clause. The
 power to extend existing terms means Congress is not required to grant
 terms that are “limited.” Thus, Judge Sentelle argued, the court had to
 interpret the term “limited Times” to give it meaning. And the best
 interpretation, Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny Congress the
 power to extend existing terms.</p>
<p>We asked the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a whole to hear
 the case. Cases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for
 important cases or cases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a
 whole, where the court will sit “en banc” to hear the case.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc.
 This time, Judge Sentelle was joined by the most liberal member of the
 D.C. Circuit, Judge David Tatel. Both the most conservative and the
 most liberal judges in the D.C. Circuit believed Congress had over-stepped its bounds.</p>
<p>It was here that most expected <i>Eldred</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i> would
 die, for the Supreme Court rarely reviews any decision by a court of
 appeals. (It hears about one hundred cases a year, out of more than
 five thousand appeals.) And it practically never reviews a decision
 that upholds a statute when no other court has yet reviewed the
 statute.</p>
<p>But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by
 granting our petition to review the D.C. Circuit opinion. Argument was
 set for October of 2002. The summer would be spent writing briefs and
 preparing for argument.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>It is over</b> a year later as I write these words. It is still
 astonishingly hard. If you know anything at all about this story, you
 know that we lost the appeal. And if you know something more than just
 the minimum, you probably think there was no way this case could have
 been won. After our defeat, I received literally thousands of missives
 by well-wishers and supporters, thanking me for my work on behalf of
 this noble but doomed cause. And none from this pile was more
 significant to me than the e-mail from my client, Eric Eldred.</p>
<p>But my client and these friends were wrong. This case could have been
 won. It should have been won. And no matter how hard I try to retell
 this story to myself, I can never escape believing that my own mistake
 lost it.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>The mistake</b> was made early, though it became obvious only at
 the very end. Our case had been supported from the very beginning by an
 extraordinary lawyer, Geoffrey Stewart, and by the law firm he had
 moved to, Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. Jones Day took a great deal of
 heat from its copyright-protectionist clients for supporting us. They
 ignored this pressure (something that few law firms today would ever
 do), and throughout the case, they gave it everything they could.</p>
<p>There were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff
 Stewart was the first, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became quite
 involved. Bromberg and Ayer in particular had a common view about how
 this case would be won: We would only win, they repeatedly told me, if
 we could make the issue seem “important” to the Supreme Court. It had
 to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free speech and free
 culture; otherwise, they would never vote against “the most powerful
 media companies in the world.”</p>
<p>I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act
 was a dramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still
 think it is. But the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based
 on how important they believe the issues are is just wrong. It might be
 “right” as in “true,” I thought, but it is “wrong” as in “it just
 shouldn’t be that way.” As I believed that any faithful interpretation
 of what the framers of our Constitution did would yield the conclusion
 that the CTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed that any faithful
 interpretation of what the First Amendment means would yield the
 conclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is
 unconstitutional, I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like
 soap. Just as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not
 because the Court likes Nazis but because such a law would violate the
 Constitution, so too, in my view, would the Court decide whether
 Congress’s law was constitutional based on the Constitution, not based
 on whether they liked the values that the framers put in the
 Constitution.</p>
<p>In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and the
 harm caused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review?
 There was no reason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they
 weren’t convinced that this regulation was harmful. So in my view, we
 didn’t need to persuade them that this law was bad, we needed to show
 why it was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter and
 in which I thought a response was appropriate. I was convinced that the
 Court would not hear our arguments if it thought these were just the
 arguments of a group of lefty loons. This Supreme Court was not about
 to launch into a new field of judicial review if it seemed that this
 field of review was simply the preference of a small political
 minority. Although my focus in the case was not to demonstrate how bad
 the Sonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it was unconstitutional,
 my hope was to make this argument against a background of briefs that
 covered the full range of political views. To show that this claim
 against the CTEA was grounded in <i>law</i> and not politics, then, we
 tried to gather the widest range of credible critics—credible not
 because they were rich and famous, but because they, in the aggregate,
 demonstrated that this law was unconstitutional regardless of one’s
 politics.</p>
<p>The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly’s
 organization, Eagle Forum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the
 very beginning. Mrs. Schlafly viewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress.
 In November 1998, she wrote a stinging editorial attacking the
 Republican Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she wrote, “Do you
 sometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to narrow
 special interests slide easily through the intricate legislative
 process, while bills that benefit the general public seem to get bogged
 down?” The answer, as the editorial documented, was the power of money.
 Schlafly enumerated Disney’s contributions to the key players on the
 committees. It was money, not justice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty
 more years in Disney’s control, Schlafly argued.</p>
<p>In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief
 supporting our position. Their brief made the argument that became the
 core claim in the Supreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of
 existing copyrights, there is no limit to Congress’s power to set
 terms. That strong conservative argument persuaded a strong
 conservative judge, Judge Sentelle.</p>
<p>In the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse as
 it gets. They included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free
 Software Foundation (home of the GNU project that made GNU/ Linux
 possible). They included a powerful brief about the costs of
 uncertainty by Intel. There were two law professors’ briefs, one by
 copyright scholars and one by First Amendment scholars. There was an
 exhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the world’s experts in the
 history of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new brief by
 Eagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments.</p>
<p>Those briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal
 argument, there were a number of powerful briefs by libraries and
 archives, including the Internet Archive, the American Association of
 Law Libraries, and the National Writers Union.</p>
<p>But two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the
 argument I’ve already described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued
 that unless the law was struck, a whole generation of American film
 would disappear. The other made the economic argument absolutely clear.</p>
<p>This economists’ brief was signed by seventeen economists, including
 five Nobel Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan,
 Milton Friedman, Kenneth Arrow, and George Akerlof. The economists, as
 the list of Nobel winners demonstrates, spanned the political spectrum.
 Their conclusions were powerful: There was no plausible claim that
 extending the terms of existing copyrights would do anything to
 increase incentives to create. Such extensions were nothing more than
 “rent-seeking”—the fancy term economists use to describe
 special-interest legislation gone wild.</p>
<p>The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we
 gathered to write our briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had
 been with us from the start. But when the case got to the Supreme
 Court, we added three lawyers to help us frame this argument to this
 Court: Alan Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, a Washington group
 that had made constitutional history with a series of seminal victories
 in the Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and
 dean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and
 who had advised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and
 finally, former solicitor general Charles Fried.</p>
<p>Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former
 solicitor general was hired by the other side to defend Congress’s
 power to give media companies the special favor of extended copyright
 terms. Fried was the only one who turned down that lucrative assignment
 to stand up for something he believed in. He had been Ronald Reagan’s
 chief lawyer in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the line of
 cases that limited Congress’s power in the context of the Commerce
 Clause. And while he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court
 that I personally disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of
 confidence in our argument.</p>
<p>The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of
 friends, as well. Significantly, however, none of these “friends”
 included historians or economists. The briefs on the other side of the
 case were written exclusively by major media companies, congressmen,
 and copyright holders.</p>
<p>The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to gain
 from the law. The congressmen were not surprising either—they were
 defending their power and, indirectly, the gravy train of contributions
 such power induced. And of course it was not surprising that the
 copyright holders would defend the idea that they should continue to
 have the right to control who did what with content they wanted to
 control.</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss’s representatives, for example, argued that it was better
 for the Dr. Seuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss’s work—better than allowing it to fall into the public domain—because if this
 creativity were in the public domain, then people could use it to
 “glorify drugs or to create pornography.”<noteref noteid="note.chap13.14"/> That was also
 the motive of the Gershwin estate, which defended its “protection” of
 the work of George Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to license<i>
 Porgy and Bess</i> to anyone who refuses to use African Americans in
 the cast.<noteref noteid="note.chap13.15"/> That’s their view of how this part of American
 culture should be controlled, and they wanted this law to help them
 effect that control.</p>
<p>This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this
 debate. When Congress decides to extend the term of existing
 copyrights, Congress is making a choice about which speakers it will
 favor. Famous and beloved copyright owners, such as the Gershwin estate
 and Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, “Give us twenty years to
 control the speech about these icons of American culture. We’ll do
 better with them than anyone else.” Congress of course likes to reward
 the popular and famous by giving them what they want. But when Congress
 gives people an exclusive right to speak in a certain way, that’s just
 what the First Amendment is traditionally meant to block.</p>
<p>We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the CTEA
 mean that there was no limit to the power of Congress to extend
 copyrights—extensions that would further concentrate the market; it
 would also mean that there was no limit to Congress’s power to play
 favorites, through copyright, with who has the right to speak.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Between February</b> and October, there was little I did beyond
 preparing for this case. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One camp we
 called “the Conservatives.” The other we called “the Rest.” The
 Conservatives included Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor,
 Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas. These five had
 been the most consistent in limiting Congress’s power. They were the
 five who had supported the <i>Lopez/Morrison</i> line of cases that
 said that an enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that
 Congress’s powers had limits.</p>
<p>The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on
 Congress’s power. These four—Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice
 Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer—had repeatedly argued that the
 Constitution gives Congress broad discretion to decide how best to
 implement its powers. In case after case, these justices had argued
 that the Court’s role should be one of deference. Though the votes of
 these four justices were the votes that I personally had most
 consistently agreed with, they were also the votes that we were least
 likely to get.</p>
<p>In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg’s. In addition
 to her general view about deference to Congress (except where issues of
 gender are involved), she had been particularly deferential in the
 context of intellectual property protections. She and her daughter (an
 excellent and well-known intellectual property scholar) were cut from
 the same intellectual property cloth. We expected she would agree with
 the writings of her daughter: that Congress had the power in this
 context to do as it wished, even if what Congress wished made little
 sense.</p>
<p>Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also viewed
 as unlikely allies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter strongly
 favored deference to Congress, as did Justice Breyer. But both were
 also very sensitive to free speech concerns. And as we strongly
 believed, there was a very important free speech argument against these
 retrospective extensions.</p>
<p>The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice
 Stevens. History will record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest
 judges on this Court. His votes are consistently eclectic, which just
 means that no simple ideology explains where he will stand. But he had
 consistently argued for limits in the context of intellectual property
 generally. We were fairly confident he would recognize limits here.</p>
<p>This analysis of “the Rest” showed most clearly where our focus had
 to be: on the Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open
 these five and get at least a majority to go our way. Thus, the single
 overriding argument that animated our claim rested on the
 Conservatives’ most important jurisprudential innovation—the argument
 that Judge Sentelle had relied upon in the Court of Appeals, that
 Congress’s power must be interpreted so that its enumerated powers have
 limits.</p>
<p>This then was the core of our strategy—a strategy for which I am
 responsible. We would get the Court to see that just as with the<i>
 Lopez</i> case, under the government’s argument here, Congress would
 always have unlimited power to extend existing terms. If anything was
 plain about Congress’s power under the Progress Clause, it was that
 this power was supposed to be “limited.” Our aim would be to get the
 Court to reconcile <i>Eldred</i> with <i>Lopez:</i> If Congress’s power
 to regulate commerce was limited, then so, too, must Congress’s power
 to regulate copyright be limited.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>The argument</b> on the government’s side came down to this:
 Congress has done it before. It should be allowed to do it again. The
 government claimed that from the very beginning, Congress has been
 extending the term of existing copyrights. So, the government argued,
 the Court should not now say that practice is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>There was some truth to the government’s claim, but not much. We
 certainly agreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831 and
 in 1909. And of course, in 1962, Congress began extending existing
 terms regularly—eleven times in forty years.</p>
<p>But this “consistency” should be kept in perspective. Congress
 extended existing terms once in the first hundred years of the
 Republic. It then extended existing terms once again in the next fifty.
 Those rare extensions are in contrast to the now regular practice of
 extending existing terms. Whatever restraint Congress had had in the
 past, that restraint was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of
 extensions; there was no reason to expect that cycle would end. This
 Court had not hesitated to intervene where Congress was in a similar
 cycle of extension. There was no reason it couldn’t intervene here.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Oral argument</b> was scheduled for the first week in October. I
 arrived in D.C. two weeks before the argument. During those two weeks,
 I was repeatedly “mooted” by lawyers who had volunteered to help in the
 case. Such “moots” are basically practice rounds, where wannabe
 justices fire questions at wannabe winners.</p>
<p>I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a
 single point: that if this extension is permitted, then there is no
 limit to the power to set terms. Going with the government would mean
 that terms would be effectively unlimited; going with us would give
 Congress a clear line to follow: Don’t extend existing terms. The moots
 were an effective practice; I found ways to take every question back to
 this central idea.</p>
<p>One moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the
 skeptic. He had served in the Reagan Justice Department with Solicitor
 General Charles Fried. He had argued many cases before the Supreme
 Court. And in his review of the moot, he let his concern speak:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I’m just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won’t be
 willing to upset this practice that the government says has been a
 consistent practice for two hundred years. You have to make them see
 the harm—passionately get them to see the harm. For if they don’t see
 that, then we haven’t any chance of winning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but he
 didn’t understand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the
 right thing—not because of politics but because it was right. As a law
 professor, I had spent my life teaching my students that this Court
 does the right thing—not because of politics but because it is right.
 As I listened to Ayer’s plea for passion in pressing politics, I
 understood his point, and I rejected it. Our argument was right. That
 was enough. Let the politicians learn to see that it was also good.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>The night before</b> the argument, a line of people began to form
 in front of the Supreme Court. The case had become a focus of the press
 and of the movement to free culture. Hundreds stood in line for the
 chance to see the proceedings. Scores spent the night on the Supreme
 Court steps so that they would be assured a seat.</p>
<p>Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can
 ask for seats they control. (I asked Justice Scalia’s chambers for
 seats for my parents, for example.) Members of the Supreme Court bar
 can get a seat in a special section reserved for them. And senators and
 congressmen have a special place where they get to sit, too. And
 finally, of course, the press has a gallery, as do clerks working for
 the Justices on the Court. As we entered that morning, there was no
 place that was not taken. This was an argument about intellectual
 property law, yet the halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat
 at the front of the Court, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I
 sat down at the table, I saw Jack Valenti sitting in the special
 section ordinarily reserved for family of the Justices.</p>
<p>When the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began where
 I intended to stay: on the question of the limits on Congress’s power.
 This was a case about enumerated powers, I said, and whether those
 enumerated powers had any limit.</p>
<p>Justice O’Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening. The
 history was bothering her.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="cont"><s>JUSTICE O’CONNOR:</s> Congress has extended the term so often
 through the years, and if you are right, don’t we run the risk of
 upsetting previous extensions of time? I mean, this seems to be a
 practice that began with the very first act.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She was quite willing to concede “that this flies directly in the
 face of what the framers had in mind.” But my response again and again
 was to emphasize limits on Congress’s power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="cont"><s>MR. LESSIG:</s> Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in
 mind, then the question is, is there a way of interpreting their words
 that gives effect to what they had in mind, and the answer is yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were two points in this argument when I should have seen where
 the Court was going. The first was a question by Justice Kennedy, who
 observed,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="cont"><s>JUSTICE KENNEDY:</s> Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that
 the ’76 act, too, should have been declared void, and that we might
 leave it alone because of the disruption, is that for all these years
 the act has impeded progress in science and the useful arts. I just
 don’t see any empirical evidence for that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a student,
 I answered,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="cont"><s>MR. LESSIG:</s> Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at
 all. Nothing in our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical
 assertion about impeding progress. Our only argument is this is a
 structural limit necessary to assure that what would be an effectively
 perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a correct answer, but it wasn’t the right answer. The right
 answer was instead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any
 number of briefs had been written about it. He wanted to hear it. And
 here was the place Don Ayer’s advice should have mattered. This was a
 softball; my answer was a swing and a miss.</p>
<p>The second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had been
 crafted. For the Chief Justice had crafted the <i>Lopez</i> ruling, and
 we hoped that he would see this case as its second cousin.</p>
<p>It was clear a second into his question that he wasn’t at all
 sympathetic. To him, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="cont"><s>CHIEF JUSTICE:</s> Well, but you want more than that. You want the
 right to copy verbatim other people’s books, don’t you?</p>
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<p class="cont"><s>MR. LESSIG:</s> We want the right to copy verbatim works that
 should be in the public domain and would be in the public domain but
 for a statute that cannot be justified under ordinary First Amendment
 analysis or under a proper reading of the limits built into the
 Copyright Clause.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things went better for us when the government gave its argument; for
 now the Court picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia
 asked Solicitor General Olson,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="cont"><s>JUSTICE SCALIA:</s> You say that the functional equivalent of an
 unlimited time would be a violation [of the Constitution], but that’s
 precisely the argument that’s being made by petitioners here, that a
 limited time which is extendable is the functional equivalent of an
 unlimited time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal.
 Olson’s flailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed
 to the academic, not the practical. The government was arguing as if
 this were the first case ever to consider limits on Congress’s
 Copyright and Patent Clause power. Ever the professor and not the
 advocate, I closed by pointing out the long history of the Court
 imposing limits on Congress’s power in the name of the Copyright and
 Patent Clause—indeed, the very first case striking a law of Congress
 as exceeding a specific enumerated power was based upon the Copyright
 and Patent Clause. All true. But it wasn’t going to move the Court to
 my side.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>As I left</b> the court that day, I knew there were a hundred
 points I wished I could remake. There were a hundred questions I wished
 I had answered differently. But one way of thinking about this case
 left me optimistic.</p>
<p>The government had been asked over and over again, what is the limit?
 Over and over again, it had answered there is no limit. This was
 precisely the answer I wanted the Court to hear. For I could not
 imagine how the Court could understand that the government believed
 Congress’s power was unlimited under the terms of the Copyright Clause,
 and sustain the government’s argument. The solicitor general had made
 my argument for me. No matter how often I tried, I could not understand
 how the Court could find that Congress’s power under the Commerce
 Clause was limited, but under the Copyright Clause, unlimited. In those
 rare moments when I let myself believe that we may have prevailed, it
 was because I felt this Court—in particular, the Conservatives—would
 feel itself constrained by the rule of law that it had established
 elsewhere.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>The morning</b> of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to
 the office and missed the 7:00 A.M. call from the Supreme Court clerk.
 Listening to the message, I could tell in an instant that she had bad
 news to report. The Supreme Court had affirmed the decision of the Court
 of Appeals. Seven justices had voted in the majority. There were two
 dissents.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the phone
 off the hook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat down to see
 where I had been wrong in my reasoning.</p>
<p>My <i>reasoning.</i> Here was a case that pitted all the money in the
 world against <i>reasoning.</i> And here was the last naïve law
 professor, scouring the pages, looking for reasoning.</p>
<p>I first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would
 distinguish the principle in this case from the principle in <i>Lopez.</i>
 The argument was nowhere to be found. The case was not even cited. The
 argument that was the core argument of our case did not even appear in
 the Court’s opinion.</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument.
 Consistent with her view that Congress’s power was not limited
 generally, she had found Congress’s power not limited here.</p>
<p>Her opinion was perfectly reasonable—for her, and for Justice
 Souter. Neither believes in <i>Lopez.</i> It would be too much to
 expect them to write an opinion that recognized, much less explained,
 the doctrine they had worked so hard to defeat.</p>
<p>But as I realized what had happened, I couldn’t quite believe what I
 was reading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile
 limited powers with the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with the
 Progress Clause. It had never even occurred to me that they could
 reconcile the two simply <i>by not addressing the argument.</i> There
 was no inconsistency because they would not talk about the two
 together. There was therefore no principle that followed from the<i>
 Lopez</i> case: In that context, Congress’s power would be limited, but
 in this context it would not.</p>
<p>Yet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers’ values
 they would respect? By what right did they—the silent five—get to
 select the part of the Constitution they would enforce based on the
 values they thought important? We were right back to the argument that
 I said I hated at the start: I had failed to convince them that the
 issue here was important, and I had failed to recognize that however
 much I might hate a system in which the Court gets to pick the
 constitutional values that it will respect, that is the system we have.</p>
<p>Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens’s
 opinion was crafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition
 of intellectual property law should not support this unjustified
 extension of terms. He based his argument on a parallel analysis that
 had governed in the context of patents (so had we). But the rest of the
 Court discounted the parallel—without explaining how the very same
 words in the Progress Clause could come to mean totally different
 things depending upon whether the words were about patents or
 copyrights. The Court let Justice Stevens’s charge go unanswered.</p>
<p>Justice Breyer’s opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever
 written, was external to the Constitution. He argued that the term of
 copyrights has become so long as to be effectively unlimited. We had
 said that under the current term, a copyright gave an author 99.8
 percent of the value of a perpetual term. Breyer said we were wrong,
 that the actual number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual term. Either
 way, the point was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be
 “limited,” and the existing term was so long as to be effectively
 unlimited, then it was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>These two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But
 because neither believed in the <i>Lopez</i> case, neither was willing
 to push it as a reason to reject this extension. The case was decided
 without anyone having addressed the argument that we had carried from
 Judge Sentelle. It was <i>Hamlet</i> without the Prince.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>Defeat brings depression.</b> They say it is a sign of health when
 depression gives way to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn’t
 cure the depression. This anger was of two sorts.</p>
<p>It was first anger with the five “Conservatives.” It would have been
 one thing for them to have explained why the principle of <i>Lopez</i>
 didn’t apply in this case. That wouldn’t have been a very convincing
 argument, I don’t believe, having read it made by others, and having
 tried to make it myself. But it at least would have been an act of
 integrity. These justices in particular have repeatedly said that the
 proper mode of interpreting the Constitution is “originalism”—to first
 understand the framers’ text, interpreted in their context, in light of
 the structure of the Constitution. That method had produced <i>Lopez</i>
 and many other “originalist” rulings. Where was their “originalism”
 now?</p>
<p>Here, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain
 what the framers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they did;
 they joined an opinion that never once tried to explain how the
 structure of that clause would affect the interpretation of Congress’s
 power. And they joined an opinion that didn’t even try to explain why
 this grant of power could be unlimited, whereas the Commerce Clause
 would be limited. In short, they had joined an opinion that did not
 apply to, and was inconsistent with, their own method for interpreting
 the Constitution. This opinion may well have yielded a result that they
 liked. It did not produce a reason that was consistent with their own
 principles.</p>
<p>My anger with the Conservatives quickly yielded to anger with myself.
 For I had let a view of the law that I liked interfere with a view of
 the law as it is.</p>
<p>Most lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for
 idealism about courts in general and this Supreme Court in particular.
 Most have a much more pragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that this case
 would be won based on whether I could convince the Justices that the
 framers’ values were important, I fought the idea, because I didn’t
 want to believe that that is how this Court decides. I insisted on
 arguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of
 principles. I had an argument that followed in logic. I didn’t need to
 waste my time showing it should also follow in popularity.</p>
<p>As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I
 can see a hundred places where the answers could have taken the
 conversation in different directions, where the truth about the harm
 that this unchecked power will cause could have been made clear to this
 Court. Justice Kennedy in good faith wanted to be shown. I,
 idiotically, corrected his question. Justice Souter in good faith
 wanted to be shown the First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher,
 reframed the question to make the logical point. I had shown them how
 they could strike this law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a
 hundred places where I could have helped them want to, yet my
 stubbornness, my refusal to give in, stopped me. I have stood before
 hundreds of audiences trying to persuade; I have used passion in that
 effort to persuade; but I refused to stand before this audience and try
 to persuade with the passion I had used elsewhere. It was not the basis
 on which a court should decide the issue.</p>
<p>Would it have been different if I had argued it differently? Would it
 have been different if Don Ayer had argued it? Or Charles Fried? Or
 Kathleen Sullivan?</p>
<p>My friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court was
 not ready, my friends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It
 would take a great deal more to show our society why our framers were
 right. And when we do that, we will be able to show that Court.</p>
<p>Maybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in
 doing anything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have
 little reason to resist doing right. I can’t help but think that if I
 had stepped down from this pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I
 could have persuaded.</p>
<p>And even if I couldn’t, then that doesn’t excuse what happened in
 January. For at the start of this case, one of America’s leading
 intellectual property professors stated publicly that my bringing this
 case was a mistake. “The Court is not ready,” Peter Jaszi said; this
 issue should not be raised until it is.</p>
<p>After the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and
 publicly, that he was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have
 been persuaded, then that is all the evidence that’s needed to know
 that here again Peter was right. Either I was not ready to argue this
 case in a way that would do some good or they were not ready to hear
 this case in a way that would do some good. Either way, the decision to
 bring this case—a decision I had made four years before—was wrong.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>While the reaction</b> to the Sonny Bono Act itself was almost
 unanimously negative, the reaction to the Court’s decision was mixed.
 No one, at least in the press, tried to say that extending the term of
 copyright was a good idea. We had won that battle over ideas. Where the
 decision was praised, it was praised by papers that had been skeptical
 of the Court’s activism in other cases. Deference was a good thing,
 even if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was
 attacked, it was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful
 law. <i>The New York Times</i> wrote in its editorial,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In effect, the Supreme Court’s decision makes it likely that we are
 seeing the beginning of the end of public domain and the birth of
 copyright perpetuity. The public domain has been a grand experiment,
 one that should not be allowed to die. The ability to draw freely on
 the entire creative output of humanity is one of the reasons we live in
 a time of such fruitful creative ferment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best responses were in the cartoons. There was a gaggle of
 hilarious images—of Mickey in jail and the like. The best, from my
 view of the case, was Ruben Bolling’s, reproduced on the next page. The
 “powerful and wealthy” line is a bit unfair. But the punch in the face
 felt exactly like that.</p>
<p>The image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the
 quote from <i>The New York Times.</i> That “grand experiment” we call
 the “public domain” is over? When I can make light of it, I think,
 “Honey, I shrunk the Constitution.” But I can rarely make light of it.
 We had in our Constitution a commitment to free culture. In the case
 that I fathered, the Supreme Court effectively renounced that
 commitment. A better lawyer would have made them see differently.</p>

<h2 id='ch14'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN: Eldred II</h2>

<p><b>The day</b> <i>Eldred</i> was decided, fate would have it that I
 was to travel to Washington, D.C. (The day the rehearing petition in<i>
 Eldred</i> was denied—meaning the case was really finally over—fate
 would have it that I was giving a speech to technologists at Disney
 World.) This was a particularly long flight to my least favorite city.
 The drive into the city from Dulles was delayed because of traffic, so
 I opened up my computer and wrote an op-ed piece.</p>
<p>It was an act of contrition. During the whole of the flight from San
 Francisco to Washington, I had heard over and over again in my head the
 same advice from Don Ayer: You need to make them see why it is
 important. And alternating with that command was the question of
 Justice Kennedy: “For all these years the act has impeded progress in
 science and the useful arts. I just don’t see any empirical evidence
 for that.” And so, having failed in the argument of constitutional
 principle, finally, I turned to an argument of politics.</p>

<p><i>The New York Times</i> published the piece. In it, I proposed a simple fix: Fifty years
 after a work has been published, the copyright owner would be required
 to register the work and pay a small fee. If he paid the fee, he got
 the benefit of the full term of copyright. If he did not, the work
 passed into the public domain.
</p><p>We called this the Eldred Act, but that was just to give it a name.
 Eric Eldred was kind enough to let his name be used once again, but as
 he said early on, it won’t get passed unless it has another name.</p>
<p>Or another two names. For depending upon your perspective, this is
 either the “Public Domain Enhancement Act” or the “Copyright Term
 Deregulation Act.” Either way, the essence of the idea is clear and
 obvious: Remove copyright where it is doing nothing except blocking
 access and the spread of knowledge. Leave it for as long as Congress
 allows for those works where its worth is at least $1. But for
 everything else, let the content go.</p>
<p>The reaction to this idea was amazingly strong. Steve Forbes endorsed
 it in an editorial. I received an avalanche of e-mail and letters
 expressing support. When you focus the issue on lost creativity, people
 can see the copyright system makes no sense. As a good Republican might
 say, here government regulation is simply getting in the way of
 innovation and creativity. And as a good Democrat might say, here the
 government is blocking access and the spread of knowledge for no good
 reason. Indeed, there is no real difference between Democrats and
 Republicans on this issue. Anyone can recognize the stupid harm of the
 present system.</p>
<p>Indeed, many recognized the obvious benefit of the registration
 requirement. For one of the hardest things about the current system for
 people who want to license content is that there is no obvious place to
 look for the current copyright owners. Since registration is not
 required, since marking content is not required, since no formality at
 all is required, it is often impossibly hard to locate copyright owners
 to ask permission to use or license their work. This system would lower
 these costs, by establishing at least one registry where copyright
 owners could be identified.</p>
<p>As I described in chapter 10, formalities in copyright law were
 removed in 1976, when Congress followed the Europeans by abandoning any
 formal requirement before a copyright is granted.<noteref noteid="note.chap14.1"/> The
 Europeans are said to view copyright as a “natural right.” Natural
 rights don’t need forms to exist. Traditions, like the Anglo-American
 tradition that required copyright owners to follow form if their rights
 were to be protected, did not, the Europeans thought, properly respect
 the dignity of the author. My right as a creator turns on my
 creativity, not upon the special favor of the government.</p>
<p>That’s great rhetoric. It sounds wonderfully romantic. But it is
 absurd copyright policy. It is absurd especially for authors, because a
 world without formalities harms the creator. The ability to spread
 “Walt Disney creativity” is destroyed when there is no simple way to
 know what’s protected and what’s not.</p>
<p>The fight against formalities achieved its first real victory in
 Berlin in 1908. International copyright lawyers amended the Berne
 Convention in 1908, to require copyright terms of life plus fifty
 years, as well as the abolition of copyright formalities. The
 formalities were hated because the stories of inadvertent loss were
 increasingly common. It was as if a Charles Dickens character ran all
 copyright offices, and the failure to dot an <i>i</i> or cross a <i>t</i>
 resulted in the loss of widows’ only income.</p>
<p>These complaints were real and sensible. And the strictness of the
 formalities, especially in the United States, was absurd. The law
 should always have ways of forgiving innocent mistakes. There is no
 reason copyright law couldn’t, as well. Rather than abandoning
 formalities totally, the response in Berlin should have been to embrace
 a more equitable system of registration.</p>
<p>Even that would have been resisted, however, because registration in
 the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was still expensive. It was also
 a hassle. The abolishment of formalities promised not only to save the
 starving widows, but also to lighten an unnecessary regulatory burden
 imposed upon creators.</p>
<p>In addition to the practical complaint of authors in 1908, there was
 a moral claim as well. There was no reason that creative property
 should be a second-class form of property. If a carpenter builds a
 table, his rights over the table don’t depend upon filing a form with
 the government. He has a property right over the table “naturally,” and
 he can assert that right against anyone who would steal the table,
 whether or not he has informed the government of his ownership of the
 table.</p>
<p>This argument is correct, but its implications are misleading. For
 the argument in favor of formalities does not depend upon creative
 property being second-class property. The argument in favor of
 formalities turns upon the special problems that creative property
 presents. The law of formalities responds to the special physics of
 creative property, to assure that it can be efficiently and fairly
 spread.</p>
<p>No one thinks, for example, that land is second-class property just
 because you have to register a deed with a court if your sale of land
 is to be effective. And few would think a car is second-class property
 just because you must register the car with the state and tag it with a
 license. In both of those cases, everyone sees that there is an
 important reason to secure registration—both because it makes the
 markets more efficient and because it better secures the rights of the
 owner. Without a registration system for land, landowners would
 perpetually have to guard their property. With registration, they can
 simply point the police to a deed. Without a registration system for
 cars, auto theft would be much easier. With a registration system, the
 thief has a high burden to sell a stolen car. A slight burden is placed
 on the property owner, but those burdens produce a much better system
 of protection for property generally.</p>
<p>It is similarly special physics that makes formalities important in
 copyright law. Unlike a carpenter’s table, there’s nothing in nature
 that makes it relatively obvious who might own a particular bit of
 creative property. A recording of Lyle Lovett’s latest album can exist
 in a billion places without anything necessarily linking it back to a
 particular owner. And like a car, there’s no way to buy and sell
 creative property with confidence unless there is some simple way to
 authenticate who is the author and what rights he has. Simple
 transactions are destroyed in a world without formalities. Complex,
 expensive, <i>lawyer</i> transactions take their place.</p>
<p>This was the understanding of the problem with the Sonny Bono Act
 that we tried to demonstrate to the Court. This was the part it didn’t
 “get.” Because we live in a system without formalities, there is no way
 easily to build upon or use culture from our past. If copyright terms
 were, as Justice Story said they would be, “short,” then this wouldn’t
 matter much. For fourteen years, under the framers’ system, a work
 would be presumptively controlled. After fourteen years, it would be
 presumptively uncontrolled.</p>
<p>But now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the
 inability to know what is protected and what is not protected becomes a
 huge and obvious burden on the creative process. If the only way a
 library can offer an Internet exhibit about the New Deal is to hire a
 lawyer to clear the rights to every image and sound, then the copyright
 system is burdening creativity in a way that has never been seen before<i>
 because there are no formalities.</i></p>
<p>The Eldred Act was designed to respond to exactly this problem. If it
 is worth $1 to you, then register your work and you can get the longer
 term. Others will know how to contact you and, therefore, how to get
 your permission if they want to use your work. And you will get the
 benefit of an extended copyright term.</p>
<p>If it isn’t worth it to you to register to get the benefit of an
 extended term, then it shouldn’t be worth it for the government to
 defend your monopoly over that work either. The work should pass into
 the public domain where anyone can copy it, or build archives with it,
 or create a movie based on it. It should become free if it is not worth
 $1 to you.</p>
<p>Some worry about the burden on authors. Won’t the burden of
 registering the work mean that the $1 is really misleading? Isn’t the
 hassle worth more than $1? Isn’t that the real problem with
 registration?</p>
<p>It is. The hassle is terrible. The system that exists now is awful. I
 completely agree that the Copyright Office has done a terrible job (no
 doubt because they are terribly funded) in enabling simple and cheap
 registrations. Any real solution to the problem of formalities must
 address the real problem of <i>governments</i> standing at the core of
 any system of formalities. In this book, I offer such a solution. That
 solution essentially remakes the Copyright Office. For now, assume it
 was Amazon that ran the registration system. Assume it was one-click
 registration. The Eldred Act would propose a simple, one-click
 registration fifty years after a work was published. Based upon
 historical data, that system would move up to 98 percent of commercial
 work, commercial work that no longer had a commercial life, into the
 public domain within fifty years. What do you think?</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>When Steve Forbes</b> endorsed the idea, some in Washington began
 to pay attention. Many people contacted me pointing to representatives
 who might be willing to introduce the Eldred Act. And I had a few who
 directly suggested that they might be willing to take the first step.</p>
<p>One representative, Zoe Lofgren of California, went so far as to get
 the bill drafted. The draft solved any problem with international law.
 It imposed the simplest requirement upon copyright owners possible. In
 May 2003, it looked as if the bill would be introduced. On May 16, I
 posted on the Eldred Act blog, “we are close.” There was a general
 reaction in the blog community that something good might happen here.</p>
<p>But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene. Jack Valenti and
 the MPAA general counsel came to the congresswoman’s office to give the
 view of the MPAA. Aided by his lawyer, as Valenti told me, Valenti
 informed the congresswoman that the MPAA would oppose the Eldred Act.
 The reasons are embarrassingly thin. More importantly, their thinness
 shows something clear about what this debate is really about.</p>
<p>The MPAA argued first that Congress had “firmly rejected the central
 concept in the proposed bill”—that copyrights be renewed. That was
 true, but irrelevant, as Congress’s “firm rejection” had occurred long
 before the Internet made subsequent uses much more likely. Second, they
 argued that the proposal would harm poor copyright owners—apparently
 those who could not afford the $1 fee. Third, they argued that Congress
 had determined that extending a copyright term would encourage
 restoration work. Maybe in the case of the small percentage of work
 covered by copyright law that is still commercially valuable, but again
 this was irrelevant, as the proposal would not cut off the extended
 term unless the $1 fee was not paid. Fourth, the MPAA argued that the
 bill would impose “enormous” costs, since a registration system is not
 free. True enough, but those costs are certainly less than the costs of
 clearing the rights for a copyright whose owner is not known. Fifth,
 they worried about the risks if the copyright to a story underlying a
 film were to pass into the public domain. But what risk is that? If it
 is in the public domain, then the film is a valid derivative use.</p>
<p>Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright owners
 to do this if they wanted. But the whole point is that there are
 thousands of copyright owners who don’t even know they have a copyright
 to give. Whether they are free to give away their copyright or not—a
 controversial claim in any case—unless they know about a copyright,
 they’re not likely to.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>At the beginning</b> of this book, I told two stories about the
 law reacting to changes in technology. In the one, common sense
 prevailed. In the other, common sense was delayed. The difference
 between the two stories was the power of the opposition—the power of
 the side that fought to defend the status quo. In both cases, a new
 technology threatened old interests. But in only one case did those
 interest’s have the power to protect themselves against this new
 competitive threat.</p>
<p>I used these two cases as a way to frame the war that this book has
 been about. For here, too, a new technology is forcing the law to
 react. And here, too, we should ask, is the law following or resisting
 common sense? If common sense supports the law, what explains this
 common sense?</p>
<p>When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the
 copyright owners. The commercial piracy that I described is wrong and
 harmful, and the law should work to eliminate it. When the issue is p2p
 sharing, it is easy to understand why the law backs the owners still:
 Much of this sharing is wrong, even if much is harmless. When the issue
 is copyright terms for the Mickey Mouses of the world, it is possible
 still to understand why the law favors Hollywood: Most people don’t
 recognize the reasons for limiting copyright terms; it is thus still
 possible to see good faith within the resistance.</p>
<p>But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the Eldred
Act, then, finally, there is an example that lays bare the naked
self-interest driving this war. This act would free an extraordinary
range of content that is otherwise unused. It wouldn’t interfere with
any copyright owner’s desire to exercise continued control over his
content. It would simply liberate what Kevin Kelly calls the “Dark
Content” that fills archives around the world. So when the warriors
oppose a change like this, we should ask one simple question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does this industry really want?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content. So
 the effort to block something like the Eldred Act is not really about
 protecting <i>their</i> content. The effort to block the Eldred Act is
 an effort to assure that nothing more passes into the public domain. It
 is another step to assure that the public domain will never compete,
 that there will be no use of content that is not commercially
 controlled, and that there will be no commercial use of content that
 doesn’t require <i>their</i> permission first.</p>
<p>The opposition to the Eldred Act reveals how extreme the other side
 is. The most powerful and sexy and well loved of lobbies really has as
 its aim not the protection of “property” but the rejection of a
 tradition. Their aim is not simply to protect what is theirs. <i>Their
 aim is to assure that all there is is what is theirs.</i></p>
<p>It is not hard to understand why the warriors take this view. It is
 not hard to see why it would benefit them if the competition of the
 public domain tied to the Internet could somehow be quashed. Just as
 RCA feared the competition of FM, they fear the competition of a public
 domain connected to a public that now has the means to create with it
 and to share its own creation.</p>
<p>What is hard to understand is why the public takes this view. It is
 as if the law made airplanes trespassers. The MPAA stands with the
 Causbys and demands that their remote and useless property rights be
 respected, so that these remote and forgotten copyright holders might
 block the progress of others.</p>
<p>All this seems to follow easily from this untroubled acceptance of
 the “property” in intellectual property. Common sense supports it, and
 so long as it does, the assaults will rain down upon the technologies
 of the Internet. The consequence will be an increasing “permission
 society.” The past can be cultivated only if you can identify the owner
 and gain permission to build upon his work. The future will be
 controlled by this dead (and often unfindable) hand of the past.</p>

<h1 id='conclusion'>CONCLUSION</h1>

<p><b>There are more</b> than 35 million people with the AIDS virus
 worldwide. Twenty-five million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Seventeen million have already died. Seventeen million Africans is
 proportional percentage-wise to seven million Americans. More
 importantly, it is seventeen million Africans.</p>
<p>There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs to slow its
 progression. These antiretroviral therapies are still experimental, but
 they have already had a dramatic effect. In the United States, AIDS
 patients who regularly take a cocktail of these drugs increase their
 life expectancy by ten to twenty years. For some, the drugs make the
 disease almost invisible.</p>
<p>These drugs are expensive. When they were first introduced in the
 United States, they cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per person per
 year. Today, some cost $25,000 per year. At these prices, of course, no
 African nation can afford the drugs for the vast majority of its
 population: $15,000 is thirty times the per capita gross national
 product of Zimbabwe. At these prices, the drugs are totally
 unavailable.<noteref noteid="note.conc1"/></p>
<p>These prices are not high because the ingredients of the drugs are
 expensive. These prices are high because the drugs are protected by
 patents. The drug companies that produced these life-saving mixes enjoy
 at least a twenty-year monopoly for their inventions. They use that
 monopoly power to extract the most they can from the market. That power
 is in turn used to keep the prices high.</p>
<p>There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug patents.
 I am not. Indeed, of all the areas of research that might be supported
 by patents, drug research is, in my view, the clearest case where
 patents are needed. The patent gives the drug company some assurance
 that if it is successful in inventing a new drug to treat a disease, it
 will be able to earn back its investment and more. This is socially an
 extremely valuable incentive. I am the last person who would argue that
 the law should abolish it, at least without other changes.</p>
<p>But it is one thing to support patents, even drug patents. It is
 another thing to determine how best to deal with a crisis. And as
 African leaders began to recognize the devastation that AIDS was
 bringing, they started looking for ways to import HIV treatments at
 costs significantly below the market price.</p>
<p>In 1997, South Africa tried one tack. It passed a law to allow the
 importation of patented medicines that had been produced or sold in
 another nation’s market with the consent of the patent owner. For
 example, if the drug was sold in India, it could be imported into
 Africa from India. This is called “parallel importation,” and it is
 generally permitted under international trade law and is specifically
 permitted within the European Union.<noteref noteid="note.conc2"/></p>
<p>However, the United States government opposed the bill. Indeed, more
 than opposed. As the International Intellectual Property Association
 characterized it, “The U.S. government pressured South Africa . . . not
 to permit compulsory licensing or parallel imports.”<noteref noteid="note.conc3"/>
Through the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the
government asked South Africa to change the law—and to add pressure to
that request, in 1998, the USTR listed South Africa for possible trade
sanctions. That same year, more than forty pharmaceutical companies
began proceedings in the South African courts to challenge the
government’s actions. The United States was then joined by other
governments from the EU. Their claim, and the claim of the
pharmaceutical companies, was that South Africa was violating its
obligations under international law by discriminating against a
particular kind of patent—pharmaceutical patents. The demand of these
governments, with the United States in the lead, was that South Africa
respect these patents as it respects any other patent, regardless of
any effect on the treatment of AIDS within South Africa.<noteref noteid="note.conc4"/></p>
<p>We should place the intervention by the United States in context. No
 doubt patents are not the most important reason that Africans don’t
 have access to drugs. Poverty and the total absence of an effective
 health care infrastructure matter more. But whether patents are the
 most important reason or not, the price of drugs has an effect on their
 demand, and patents affect price. And so, whether massive or marginal,
 there was an effect from our government’s intervention to stop the flow
 of medications into Africa.</p>
<p>By stopping the flow of HIV treatment into Africa, the United States
 government was not saving drugs for United States citizens. This is not
 like wheat (if they eat it, we can’t); instead, the flow that the
 United States intervened to stop was, in effect, a flow of knowledge:
 information about how to take chemicals that exist within Africa, and
 turn those chemicals into drugs that would save 15 to 30 million lives.</p>
<p>Nor was the intervention by the United States going to protect the
 profits of United States drug companies—at least, not substantially.
 It was not as if these countries were in the position to buy the drugs
 for the prices the drug companies were charging. Again, the Africans
 are wildly too poor to afford these drugs at the offered prices.
 Stopping the parallel import of these drugs would not substantially
 increase the sales by U.S. companies.</p>
<p>Instead, the argument in favor of restricting this flow of
 information, which was needed to save the lives of millions, was an
 argument about the sanctity of property.<noteref noteid="note.conc5"/> It was because
 “intellectual property” would be violated that these drugs should not
 flow into Africa. It was a principle about the importance of
 “intellectual property” that led these government actors to intervene
 against the South African response to AIDS.</p>
<p>Now just step back for a moment. There will be a time thirty years
 from now when our children look back at us and ask, how could we have
 let this happen? How could we allow a policy to be pursued whose direct
 cost would be to speed the death of 15 to 30 million Africans, and
 whose only real benefit would be to uphold the “sanctity” of an idea?
 What possible justification could there ever be for a policy that
 results in so many deaths? What exactly is the insanity that would
 allow so many to die for such an abstraction?</p>
<p>Some blame the drug companies. I don’t. They are corporations. Their
 managers are ordered by law to make money for the corporation. They
 push a certain patent policy not because of ideals, but because it is
 the policy that makes them the most money. And it only makes them the
 most money because of a certain corruption within our political
 system—a corruption the drug companies are certainly not responsible
 for.</p>
<p>The corruption is our own politicians’ failure of integrity. For the
 drug companies would love—they say, and I believe them—to sell their
 drugs as cheaply as they can to countries in Africa and elsewhere.
 There are issues they’d have to resolve to make sure the drugs didn’t
 get back into the United States, but those are mere problems of
 technology. They could be overcome.</p>
<p>A different problem, however, could not be overcome. This is the fear
 of the grandstanding politician who would call the presidents of the
 drug companies before a Senate or House hearing, and ask, “How is it
 you can sell this HIV drug in Africa for only $1 a pill, but the same
 drug would cost an American $1,500?” Because there is no “sound bite”
 answer to that question, its effect would be to induce regulation of
 prices in America. The drug companies thus avoid this spiral by
 avoiding the first step. They reinforce the idea that property should
 be sacred. They adopt a rational strategy in an irrational context,
 with the unintended consequence that perhaps millions die. And that
 rational strategy thus becomes framed in terms of this ideal—the
 sanctity of an idea called “intellectual property.”</p>
<p>So when the common sense of your child confronts you, what will you
 say? When the common sense of a generation finally revolts against what
 we have done, how will we justify what we have done? What is the
 argument?</p>
<p>A sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support the
 patent system without having to reach everyone everywhere in exactly
 the same way. Just as a sensible copyright policy could endorse and
 strongly support a copyright system without having to regulate the
 spread of culture perfectly and forever, a sensible patent policy could
 endorse and strongly support a patent system without having to block
 the spread of drugs to a country not rich enough to afford market
 prices in any case. A sensible policy, in other words, could be a
 balanced policy. For most of our history, both copyright and patent
 policies were balanced in just this sense.</p>
<p>But we as a culture have lost this sense of balance. We have lost the
 critical eye that helps us see the difference between truth and
 extremism. A certain property fundamentalism, having no connection to
 our tradition, now reigns in this culture—bizarrely, and with
 consequences more grave to the spread of ideas and culture than almost
 any other single policy decision that we as a democracy will make.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>A simple idea</b> blinds us, and under the cover of darkness, much
 happens that most of us would reject if any of us looked. So
 uncritically do we accept the idea of property in ideas that we don’t
 even notice how monstrous it is to deny ideas to a people who are dying
 without them. So uncritically do we accept the idea of property in
 culture that we don’t even question when the control of that property
 removes our ability, as a people, to develop our culture
 democratically. Blindness becomes our common sense. And the challenge
 for anyone who would reclaim the right to cultivate our culture is to
 find a way to make this common sense open its eyes.</p>
<p>So far, common sense sleeps. There is no revolt. Common sense does
 not yet see what there could be to revolt about. The extremism that now
 dominates this debate fits with ideas that seem natural, and that fit
 is reinforced by the RCAs of our day. They wage a frantic war to fight
 “piracy,” and devastate a culture for creativity. They defend the idea
 of “creative property,” while transforming real creators into
 modern-day sharecroppers. They are insulted by the idea that rights
 should be balanced, even though each of the major players in this
 content war was itself a beneficiary of a more balanced ideal. The
 hypocrisy reeks. Yet in a city like Washington, hypocrisy is not even
 noticed. Powerful lobbies, complex issues, and MTV attention spans
 produce the “perfect storm” for free culture.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>In August 2003,</b> a fight broke out in the United States about a
 decision by the World Intellectual Property Organization to cancel a
 meeting.<noteref noteid="note.conc6"/>
At the request of a wide range of interests, WIPO had decided to hold a
meeting to discuss “open and collaborative projects to create public
goods.” These are projects that have been successful in producing
public goods without relying exclusively upon a proprietary use of
intellectual property. Examples include the Internet and the World Wide
Web, both of which were developed on the basis of protocols in the
public domain. It included an emerging trend to support open academic
journals, including the Public Library of Science project that I
describe in the Afterword. It included a project to develop single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are thought to have great
significance in biomedical research. (That nonprofit project comprised
a consortium of the Wellcome Trust and pharmaceutical and technological
companies, including Amersham Biosciences, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Bayer,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Hoffmann-La Roche, Glaxo-SmithKline, IBM,
Motorola, Novartis, Pfizer, and Searle.) It included the Global
Positioning System, which Ronald Reagan set free in the early 1980s.
And it included “open source and free software.”</p>
<p>The aim of the meeting was to consider this wide range of projects
 from one common perspective: that none of these projects relied upon
 intellectual property extremism. Instead, in all of them, intellectual
 property was balanced by agreements to keep access open or to impose
 limitations on the way in which proprietary claims might be used.</p>
<p>From the perspective of this book, then, the conference was ideal.<noteref noteid="note.conc7"/> The projects within its scope included both commercial and
 noncommercial work. They primarily involved science, but from many
 perspectives. And WIPO was an ideal venue for this discussion, since
 WIPO is the preeminent international body dealing with intellectual
 property issues.</p>
<p>Indeed, I was once publicly scolded for not recognizing this fact
 about WIPO. In February 2003, I delivered a keynote address to a
 preparatory conference for the World Summit on the Information Society
 (WSIS). At a press conference before the address, I was asked what I
 would say. I responded that I would be talking a little about the
 importance of balance in intellectual property for the development of
 an information society. The moderator for the event then promptly
 interrupted to inform me and the assembled reporters that no question
 about intellectual property would be discussed by WSIS, since those
 questions were the exclusive domain of WIPO. In the talk that I had
 prepared, I had actually made the issue of intellectual property
 relatively minor. But after this astonishing statement, I made
 intellectual property the sole focus of my talk. There was no way to
 talk about an “Information Society” unless one also talked about the
 range of information and culture that would be free. My talk did not
 make my immoderate moderator very happy. And she was no doubt correct
 that the scope of intellectual property protections was ordinarily the
 stuff of WIPO. But in my view, there couldn’t be too much of a
 conversation about how much intellectual property is needed, since in
 my view, the very idea of balance in intellectual property had been
 lost.</p>
<p>So whether or not WSIS can discuss balance in intellectual property,
 I had thought it was taken for granted that WIPO could and should. And
 thus the meeting about “open and collaborative projects to create
 public goods” seemed perfectly appropriate within the WIPO agenda.</p>
<p>But there is one project within that list that is highly
 controversial, at least among lobbyists. That project is “open source
 and free software.” Microsoft in particular is wary of discussion of
 the subject. From its perspective, a conference to discuss open source
 and free software would be like a conference to discuss Apple’s
 operating system. Both open source and free software compete with
 Microsoft’s software. And internationally, many governments have begun
 to explore requirements that they use open source or free software,
 rather than “proprietary software,” for their own internal uses.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to enter that debate here. It is important only to make
 clear that the distinction is not between commercial and noncommercial
 software. There are many important companies that depend fundamentally
 upon open source and free software, IBM being the most prominent. IBM
 is increasingly shifting its focus to the GNU/Linux operating system,
 the most famous bit of “free software”—and IBM is emphatically a
 commercial entity. Thus, to support “open source and free software” is
 not to oppose commercial entities. It is, instead, to support a mode of
 software development that is different from Microsoft’s.<noteref noteid="note.conc8"/></p>
<p>More important for our purposes, to support “open source and free
 software” is not to oppose copyright. “Open source and free software”
 is not software in the public domain. Instead, like Microsoft’s
 software, the copyright owners of free and open source software insist
 quite strongly that the terms of their software license be respected by
 adopters of free and open source software. The terms of that license
 are no doubt different from the terms of a proprietary software
 license. Free software licensed under the General Public License (GPL),
 for example, requires that the source code for the software be made
 available by anyone who modifies and redistributes the software. But
 that requirement is effective only if copyright governs software. If
 copyright did not govern software, then free software could not impose
 the same kind of requirements on its adopters. It thus depends upon
 copyright law just as Microsoft does.</p>
<p>It is therefore understandable that as a proprietary software
 developer, Microsoft would oppose this WIPO meeting, and understandable
 that it would use its lobbyists to get the United States government to
 oppose it, as well. And indeed, that is just what was reported to have
 happened. According to Jonathan Krim of the <i>Washington Post,</i>
 Microsoft’s lobbyists succeeded in getting the United States government
 to veto the meeting.<noteref noteid="note.conc9"/> And without U.S. backing, the meeting
 was canceled.</p>
<p>I don’t blame Microsoft for doing what it can to advance its own
 interests, consistent with the law. And lobbying governments is plainly
 consistent with the law. There was nothing surprising about its
 lobbying here, and nothing terribly surprising about the most powerful
 software producer in the United States having succeeded in its lobbying
 efforts.</p>
<p>What was surprising was the United States government’s reason for
 opposing the meeting. Again, as reported by Krim, Lois Boland, acting
 director of international relations for the U.S. Patent and Trademark
 Office, explained that “open-source software runs counter to the
 mission of WIPO, which is to promote intellectual-property rights.” She
 is quoted as saying, “To hold a meeting which has as its purpose to
 disclaim or waive such rights seems to us to be contrary to the goals
 of WIPO.”</p>
<p>These statements are astonishing on a number of levels.</p>
<p>First, they are just flat wrong. As I described, most open source and
 free software relies fundamentally upon the intellectual property right
 called “copyright.” Without it, restrictions imposed by those licenses
 wouldn’t work. Thus, to say it “runs counter” to the mission of
 promoting intellectual property rights reveals an extraordinary gap in
 understanding—the sort of mistake that is excusable in a first-year
 law student, but an embarrassment from a high government official
 dealing with intellectual property issues.</p>
<p>Second, who ever said that WIPO’s exclusive aim was to “promote”
 intellectual property maximally? As I had been scolded at the
 preparatory conference of WSIS, WIPO is to consider not only how best
 to protect intellectual property, but also what the best balance of
 intellectual property is. As every economist and lawyer knows, the hard
 question in intellectual property law is to find that balance. But that
 there should be limits is, I had thought, uncontested. One wants to ask
 Ms. Boland, are generic drugs (drugs based on drugs whose patent has
 expired) contrary to the WIPO mission? Does the public domain weaken
 intellectual property? Would it have been better if the protocols of
 the Internet had been patented?</p>
<p>Third, even if one believed that the purpose of WIPO was to maximize
 intellectual property rights, in our tradition, intellectual property
 rights are held by individuals and corporations. They get to decide
 what to do with those rights because, again, they are <i>their</i>
 rights. If they want to “waive” or “disclaim” their rights, that is,
 within our tradition, totally appropriate. When Bill Gates gives away
 more than $20 billion to do good in the world, that is not inconsistent
 with the objectives of the property system. That is, on the contrary,
 just what a property system is supposed to be about: giving individuals
 the right to decide what to do with <i>their</i> property.</p>
<p>When Ms. Boland says that there is something wrong with a meeting
“which has as its purpose to disclaim or waive such rights,” she’s
saying that WIPO has an interest in interfering with the choices of the
individuals who own intellectual property rights. That somehow, WIPO’s
objective should be to stop an individual from “waiving” or
“disclaiming” an intellectual property right. That the interest of
WIPO is not just that intellectual property rights be maximized, but
that they also should be exercised in the most extreme and restrictive
way possible.</p>
<p>There is a history of just such a property system that is well known
 in the Anglo-American tradition. It is called “feudalism.” Under
 feudalism, not only was property held by a relatively small number of
 individuals and entities. And not only were the rights that ran with
 that property powerful and extensive. But the feudal system had a
 strong interest in assuring that property holders within that system
 not weaken feudalism by liberating people or property within their
 control to the free market. Feudalism depended upon maximum control and
 concentration. It fought any freedom that might interfere with that
 control.</p>
<p>As Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite relate, this is precisely the
 choice we are now making about intellectual property.<noteref noteid="note.conc10"/> We
 will have an information society. That much is certain. Our only choice
 now is whether that information society will be <i>free</i> or<i>
 feudal.</i> The trend is toward the feudal.</p>
<p>When this battle broke, I blogged it. A spirited debate within the
 comment section ensued. Ms. Boland had a number of supporters who tried
 to show why her comments made sense. But there was one comment that was
 particularly depressing for me. An anonymous poster wrote,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>George, you misunderstand Lessig: He’s only talking about the world
 as it should be (“the goal of WIPO, and the goal of any government,
 should be to promote the right balance of intellectual-property
 rights, not simply to promote intellectual property rights”), not as it
 is. If we were talking about the world as it is, then of course Boland
 didn’t say anything wrong. But in the world as Lessig would have it,
 then of course she did. Always pay attention to the distinction between
 Lessig’s world and ours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I missed the irony the first time I read it. I read it quickly and
 thought the poster was supporting the idea that seeking balance was
 what our government should be doing. (Of course, my criticism of Ms.
 Boland was not about whether she was seeking balance or not; my
 criticism was that her comments betrayed a first-year law student’s
 mistake. I have no illusion about the extremism of our government,
 whether Republican or Democrat. My only illusion apparently is about
 whether our government should speak the truth or not.)</p>
<p>Obviously, however, the poster was not supporting that idea. Instead,
 the poster was ridiculing the very idea that in the real world, the
 “goal” of a government should be “to promote the right balance” of
 intellectual property. That was obviously silly to him. And it
 obviously betrayed, he believed, my own silly utopianism. “Typical for
 an academic,” the poster might well have continued.</p>
<p>I understand criticism of academic utopianism. I think utopianism is
 silly, too, and I’d be the first to poke fun at the absurdly
 unrealistic ideals of academics throughout history (and not just in our
 own country’s history).</p>
<p>But when it has become silly to suppose that the role of our
 government should be to “seek balance,” then count me with the silly,
 for that means that this has become quite serious indeed. If it should
 be obvious to everyone that the government does not seek balance, that
 the government is simply the tool of the most powerful lobbyists, that
 the idea of holding the government to a different standard is absurd,
 that the idea of demanding of the government that it speak truth and
 not lies is just naïve, then who have we, the most powerful democracy
 in the world, become?</p>
<p>It might be crazy to expect a high government official to speak the
 truth. It might be crazy to believe that government policy will be
 something more than the handmaiden of the most powerful interests. It
 might be crazy to argue that we should preserve a tradition that has
 been part of our tradition for most of our history—free culture.</p>
<p>If this is crazy, then let there be more crazies. Soon.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>There are moments</b> of hope in this struggle. And moments that
 surprise. When the FCC was considering relaxing ownership rules, which
 would thereby further increase the concentration in media ownership, an
 extraordinary bipartisan coalition formed to fight this change. For
 perhaps the first time in history, interests as diverse as the NRA, the
 ACLU, Moveon.org, William Safire, Ted Turner, and CodePink Women for
 Peace organized to oppose this change in FCC policy. An astonishing
 700,000 letters were sent to the FCC, demanding more hearings and a
 different result.</p>
<p>This activism did not stop the FCC, but soon after, a broad coalition
 in the Senate voted to reverse the FCC decision. The hostile hearings
 leading up to that vote revealed just how powerful this movement had
 become. There was no substantial support for the FCC’s decision, and
 there was broad and sustained support for fighting further
 concentration in the media.</p>
<p>But even this movement misses an important piece of the puzzle.
 Largeness as such is not bad. Freedom is not threatened just because
 some become very rich, or because there are only a handful of big
 players. The poor quality of Big Macs or Quarter Pounders does not mean
 that you can’t get a good hamburger from somewhere else.</p>
<p>The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentration,
 but instead from the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the
 change in copyright, produces. It is not just that there are a few
 powerful companies that control an ever expanding slice of the media.
 It is that this concentration can call upon an equally bloated range of
 rights—property rights of a historically extreme form—that makes
 their bigness bad.</p>
<p>It is therefore significant that so many would rally to demand
 competition and increased diversity. Still, if the rally is understood
 as being about bigness alone, it is not terribly surprising. We
 Americans have a long history of fighting “big,” wisely or not. That we
 could be motivated to fight “big” again is not something new.</p>
<p>It would be something new, and something very important, if an equal
 number could be rallied to fight the increasing extremism built within
 the idea of “intellectual property.” Not because balance is alien to
 our tradition; indeed, as I’ve argued, balance is our tradition. But
 because the muscle to think critically about the scope of anything
 called “property” is not well exercised within this tradition anymore.</p>
<p>If we were Achilles, this would be our heel. This would be the place
 of our tragedy.</p>

<vsep class="emptyline"/>

<p><b>As I write</b> these final words, the news is filled with stories
 about the RIAA lawsuits against almost three hundred individuals.<noteref noteid="note.conc11"/> Eminem has just been sued for “sampling” someone else’s music.<noteref noteid="note.conc12"/> The story about Bob Dylan “stealing” from a Japanese author has
 just finished making the rounds.<noteref noteid="note.conc13"/> An insider from
 Hollywood—who insists he must remain anonymous—reports “an amazing
 conversation with these studio guys. They’ve got extraordinary [old]
 content that they’d love to use but can’t because they can’t begin to
 clear the rights. They’ve got scores of kids who could do amazing
 things with the content, but it would take scores of lawyers to clean
 it first.” Congressmen are talking about deputizing computer viruses to
 bring down computers thought to violate the law. Universities are
 threatening expulsion for kids who use a computer to share content.</p>
<p>Yet on the other side of the Atlantic, the BBC has just announced
 that it will build a “Creative Archive,” from which British citizens
 can download BBC content, and rip, mix, and burn it.<noteref noteid="note.conc14"/> And
 in Brazil, the culture minister, Gilberto Gil, himself a folk hero of
 Brazilian music, has joined with Creative Commons to release content
 and free licenses in that Latin American country.<noteref noteid="note.conc15"/></p>
<p>I’ve told a dark story. The truth is more mixed. A technology has
 given us a new freedom. Slowly, some begin to understand that this
 freedom need not mean anarchy. We can carry a free culture into the
 twenty-first century, without artists losing and without the potential
 of digital technology being destroyed. It will take some thought, and
 more importantly, it will take some will to transform the RCAs of our
 day into the Causbys.</p>

  <p><b>At least some</b> who have read this far will agree with me that something must be done to change where we are heading. The balance of this book maps what might be done.</p>
  <p>I divide this map into two parts: that which anyone can do now, and that which requires the help of lawmakers. If there is one lesson that we can draw from the history of remaking common sense, it is that it requires remaking how many people think about the very same issue.</p>
  <p>That means this movement must begin in the streets. It must recruit a significant number of parents, teachers, librarians, creators, authors, musicians, filmmakers, scientists—all to tell this story in their own words, and to tell their neighbors why this battle is so important.</p>
  <p>Once this movement has its effect in the streets, it has some hope of having an effect in Washington. We are still a democracy. What people think matters. Not as much as it should, at least when an RCA stands opposed, but still, it matters. And thus, in the second part below, I sketch changes that Congress could make to better secure a free culture.</p>

</page-sequence>
<page-sequence>

<h2 id='afterword.1'>US, NOW</h2>

<p><b>Common sense</b> is with the copyright warriors because the debate so far has been framed at the extremes—as a grand either/or: either property or anarchy, either total control or artists won’t be paid. If that really is the choice, then the warriors should win.</p>
<p>The mistake here is the error of the excluded middle. There are extremes in this debate, but the extremes are not all that there is. There are those who believe in maximal copyright—“All Rights Reserved”—and those who reject copyright—“No Rights Reserved.” The “All Rights Reserved” sorts believe that you should ask permission before you “use” a copyrighted work in any way. The “No Rights Reserved” sorts believe you should be able to do with content as you wish, regardless of whether you have permission or not.</p>
<p>When the Internet was first born, its initial architecture effectively tilted in the “no rights reserved” direction. Content could be copied perfectly and cheaply; rights could not easily be controlled. Thus, regardless of anyone’s desire, the effective regime of copyright under the original design of the Internet was “no rights reserved.” Content was “taken” regardless of the rights. Any rights were effectively unprotected.</p>
<p>This initial character produced a reaction (opposite, but not quite equal) by copyright owners. That reaction has been the topic of this book. Through legislation, litigation, and changes to the network’s design, copyright holders have been able to change the essential character of the environment of the original Internet. If the original architecture made the effective default “no rights reserved,” the future architecture will make the effective default “all rights reserved.” The architecture and law that surround the Internet’s design will increasingly produce an environment where all use of content requires permission. The “cut and paste” world that defines the Internet today will become a “get permission to cut and paste” world that is a creator’s nightmare.</p>
<p>What’s needed is a way to say something in the middle—neither “all rights reserved” nor “no rights reserved” but “some rights reserved”—and thus a way to respect copyrights but enable creators to free content as they see fit. In other words, we need a way to restore a set of freedoms that we could just take for granted before.</p>

<h2 id='afterword.1.1'>Rebuilding Freedoms Previously Presumed: Examples</h2>

<p>If you step back from the battle I’ve been describing here, you will recognize this problem from other contexts. Think about privacy. Before the Internet, most of us didn’t have to worry much about data about our lives that we broadcast to the world. If you walked into a bookstore and browsed through some of the works of Karl Marx, you didn’t need to worry about explaining your browsing habits to your neighbors or boss. The “privacy” of your browsing habits was assured.</p>
<p>What made it assured?</p>
<p>Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter 10, your privacy was assured because of an inefficient architecture for gathering data and hence a market constraint (cost) on anyone who wanted to gather that data. If you were a suspected spy for North Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your privacy would not be assured. But that’s because the CIA would (we hope) find it valuable enough to spend the thousands required to track you. But for most of us (again, we can hope), spying doesn’t pay. The highly inefficient architecture of real space means we all enjoy a fairly robust amount of privacy. That privacy is guaranteed to us by friction. Not by law (there is no law protecting “privacy” in public places), and in many places, not by norms (snooping and gossip are just fun), but instead, by the costs that friction imposes on anyone who would want to spy.</p>
<p>Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking browsing in particular has become quite tiny. If you’re a customer at Amazon, then as you browse the pages, Amazon collects the data about what you’ve looked at. You know this because at the side of the page, there’s a list of “recently viewed” pages. Now, because of the architecture of the Net and the function of cookies on the Net, it is easier to collect the data than not. The friction has disappeared, and hence any “privacy” protected by the friction disappears, too.</p>
<p>Amazon, of course, is not the problem. But we might begin to worry about libraries. If you’re one of those crazy lefties who thinks that people should have the “right” to browse in a library without the government knowing which books you look at (I’m one of those lefties, too), then this change in the technology of monitoring might concern you. If it becomes simple to gather and sort who does what in electronic spaces, then the friction-induced privacy of yesterday disappears.</p>
<p>It is this reality that explains the push of many to define “privacy” on the Internet. It is the recognition that technology can remove what friction before gave us that leads many to push for laws to do what friction did.<noteref noteid="note.us1"/> And whether you’re in favor of those laws or not, it is the pattern that is important here. We must take affirmative steps to secure a kind of freedom that was passively provided before. A change in technology now forces those who believe in privacy to affirmatively act where, before, privacy was given by default.</p>
<p>A similar story could be told about the birth of the free software movement. When computers with software were first made available commercially, the software—both the source code and the binaries—was free. You couldn’t run a program written for a Data General machine on an IBM machine, so Data General and IBM didn’t care much about controlling their software.</p>
<p>That was the world Richard Stallman was born into, and while he was a researcher at MIT, he grew to love the community that developed when one was free to explore and tinker with the software that ran on machines. Being a smart sort himself, and a talented programmer, Stallman grew to depend upon the freedom to add to or modify other people’s work.</p>
<p>In an academic setting, at least, that’s not a terribly radical idea. In a math department, anyone would be free to tinker with a proof that someone offered. If you thought you had a better way to prove a theorem, you could take what someone else did and change it. In a classics department, if you believed a colleague’s translation of a recently discovered text was flawed, you were free to improve it. Thus, to Stallman, it seemed obvious that you should be free to tinker with and improve the code that ran a machine. This, too, was knowledge. Why shouldn’t it be open for criticism like anything else?</p>
<p>No one answered that question. Instead, the architecture of revenue for computing changed. As it became possible to import programs from one system to another, it became economically attractive (at least in the view of some) to hide the code of your program. So, too, as companies started selling peripherals for mainframe systems. If I could just take your printer driver and copy it, then that would make it easier for me to sell a printer to the market than it was for you.</p>
<p>Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by the early 1980s, Stallman found himself surrounded by proprietary code.</p>
<p>The world of free software had been erased by a change in the economics of computing. And as he believed, if he did nothing about it, then the freedom to change and share software would be fundamentally weakened.</p>
<p>Therefore, in 1984, Stallman began a project to build a free operating system, so that at least a strain of free software would survive. That was the birth of the GNU project, into which Linus Torvalds’s “Linux” kernel was added to produce the GNU/Linux operating system.</p>
<p>Stallman’s technique was to use copyright law to build a world of software that must be kept free. Software licensed under the Free Software Foundation’s GPL cannot be modified and distributed unless the source code for that software is made available as well. Thus, anyone building upon GPL’d software would have to make their buildings free as well. This would assure, Stallman believed, that an ecology of code would develop that remained free for others to build upon. His fundamental goal was freedom; innovative creative code was a byproduct.</p>
<p>Stallman was thus doing for software what privacy advocates now do for privacy. He was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom that was taken for granted before. Through the affirmative use of licenses that bind copyrighted code, Stallman was affirmatively reclaiming a space where free software would survive. He was actively protecting what before had been passively guaranteed.</p>
<p>Finally, consider a very recent example that more directly resonates with the story of this book. This is the shift in the way academic and scientific journals are produced.</p>
<p>As digital technologies develop, it is becoming obvious to many that printing thousands of copies of journals every month and sending them to libraries is perhaps not the most efficient way to distribute knowledge. Instead, journals are increasingly becoming electronic, and libraries and their users are given access to these electronic journals through password-protected sites. Something similar to this has been happening in law for almost thirty years: Lexis and Westlaw have had electronic versions of case reports available to subscribers to their service. Although a Supreme Court opinion is not copyrighted, and anyone is free to go to a library and read it, Lexis and Westlaw are also free to charge users for the privilege of gaining access to that Supreme Court opinion through their respective services.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong in general with this, and indeed, the ability
 to charge for access to even public domain materials is a good
 incentive for people to develop new and innovative ways to spread
 knowledge. The law has agreed, which is why Lexis and Westlaw have been
 allowed to flourish. And if there’s nothing wrong with selling the
 public domain, then there could be nothing wrong, in principle, with
 selling access to material that is not in the public domain.</p>
<p>But what if the only way to get access to social and scientific data
 was through proprietary services? What if no one had the ability to
 browse this data except by paying for a subscription?</p>
<p>As many are beginning to notice, this is increasingly the reality
 with scientific journals. When these journals were distributed in paper
 form, libraries could make the journals available to anyone who had
 access to the library. Thus, patients with cancer could become cancer
 experts because the library gave them access. Or patients trying to
 understand the risks of a certain treatment could research those risks
 by reading all available articles about that treatment. This freedom
 was therefore a function of the institution of libraries (norms) and
 the technology of paper journals (architecture)—namely, that it was
 very hard to control access to a paper journal.</p>
<p>As journals become electronic, however, the publishers are demanding
 that libraries not give the general public access to the journals. This
 means that the freedoms provided by print journals in public libraries
 begin to disappear. Thus, as with privacy and with software, a changing
 technology and market shrink a freedom taken for granted before.</p>
<p>This shrinking freedom has led many to take affirmative steps to
 restore the freedom that has been lost. The Public Library of Science
 (PLoS), for example, is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to making
 scientific research available to anyone with a Web connection. Authors
 of scientific work submit that work to the Public Library of Science.
 That work is then subject to peer review. If accepted, the work is then
 deposited in a public, electronic archive and made permanently
 available for free. PLoS also sells a print version of its work, but
 the copyright for the print journal does not inhibit the right of
 anyone to redistribute the work for free.</p>
<p>This is one of many such efforts to restore a freedom taken for
 granted before, but now threatened by changing technology and markets.
 There’s no doubt that this alternative competes with the traditional
 publishers and their efforts to make money from the exclusive
 distribution of content. But competition in our tradition is
 presumptively a good—especially when it helps spread knowledge and
 science.</p>

<h2 id='afterword.1.2'>Rebuilding Free Culture: One Idea</h2>

<p>The same strategy could be applied to culture, as a response to the
 increasing control effected through law and technology.</p>
<p>Enter the Creative Commons. The Creative Commons is a nonprofit
 corporation established in Massachusetts, but with its home at Stanford
 University. Its aim is to build a layer of <i>reasonable</i> copyright
 on top of the extremes that now reign. It does this by making it easy
 for people to build upon other people’s work, by making it simple for
 creators to express the freedom for others to take and build upon their
 work. Simple tags, tied to human-readable descriptions, tied to bullet-proof licenses, make this possible.</p>

<p><i>Simple</i>—which means without a middleman, or without a lawyer. By
 developing a free set of licenses that people can attach to their
 content, Creative Commons aims to mark a range of content that can
 easily, and reliably, be built upon. These tags are then linked to
 machine-readable versions of the license that enable computers
 automatically to identify content that can easily be shared. These
 three expressions together—a legal license, a human-readable
 description, and machine-readable tags—constitute a Creative Commons
 license. A Creative Commons license constitutes a grant of freedom to
 anyone who accesses the license, and more importantly, an expression of
 the ideal that the person associated with the license believes in
 something different than the “All” or “No” extremes. Content is marked
 with the CC mark, which does not mean that copyright is waived, but
 that certain freedoms are given.
</p><p>These freedoms are beyond the freedoms promised by fair use. Their
 precise contours depend upon the choices the creator makes. The creator
 can choose a license that permits any use, so long as attribution is
 given. She can choose a license that permits only noncommercial use.
 She can choose a license that permits any use so long as the same
 freedoms are given to other uses (“share and share alike”). Or any use
 so long as no derivative use is made. Or any use at all within
 developing nations. Or any sampling use, so long as full copies are not
 made. Or lastly, any educational use.</p>
<p>These choices thus establish a range of freedoms beyond the default
 of copyright law. They also enable freedoms that go beyond traditional
 fair use. And most importantly, they express these freedoms in a way
 that subsequent users can use and rely upon without the need to hire a
 lawyer. Creative Commons thus aims to build a layer of content,
 governed by a layer of reasonable copyright law, that others can build
 upon. Voluntary choice of individuals and creators will make this
 content available. And that content will in turn enable us to rebuild a
 public domain.</p>
<p>This is just one project among many within the Creative Commons. And
 of course, Creative Commons is not the only organization pursuing such
 freedoms. But the point that distinguishes the Creative Commons from
 many is that we are not interested only in talking about a public
 domain or in getting legislators to help build a public domain. Our aim
 is to build a movement of consumers and producers of content (“content
 conducers,” as attorney Mia Garlick calls them) who help build the
 public domain and, by their work, demonstrate the importance of the
 public domain to other creativity.</p>
<p>The aim is not to fight the “All Rights Reserved” sorts. The aim is
 to complement them. The problems that the law creates for us as a
 culture are produced by insane and unintended consequences of laws
 written centuries ago, applied to a technology that only Jefferson
 could have imagined. The rules may well have made sense against a
 background of technologies from centuries ago, but they do not make
 sense against the background of digital technologies. New rules—with
 different freedoms, expressed in ways so that humans without lawyers
 can use them—are needed. Creative Commons gives people a way
 effectively to begin to build those rules.</p>
<p>Why would creators participate in giving up total control? Some
 participate to better spread their content. Cory Doctorow, for example,
 is a science fiction author. His first novel, <i>Down and Out in the
 Magic Kingdom,</i> was released on-line and for free, under a Creative
 Commons license, on the same day that it went on sale in bookstores.</p>
<p>Why would a publisher ever agree to this? I suspect his publisher
 reasoned like this: There are two groups of people out there: (1) those
 who will buy Cory’s book whether or not it’s on the Internet, and (2)
 those who may never hear of Cory’s book, if it isn’t made available for
 free on the Internet. Some part of (1) will download Cory’s book
 instead of buying it. Call them bad-(1)s. Some part of (2) will
 download Cory’s book, like it, and then decide to buy it. Call them
 (2)-goods. If there are more (2)-goods than bad-(1)s, the strategy of
 releasing Cory’s book free on-line will probably <i>increase</i> sales
 of Cory’s book.</p>
<p>Indeed, the experience of his publisher clearly supports that
 conclusion. The book’s first printing was exhausted months before the
 publisher had expected. This first novel of a science fiction author
 was a total success.</p>
<p>The idea that free content might increase the value of nonfree
 content was confirmed by the experience of another author. Peter
 Wayner, who wrote a book about the free software movement titled<i>
 Free for All,</i> made an electronic version of his book free on-line
 under a Creative Commons license after the book went out of print. He
 then monitored used book store prices for the book. As predicted, as
 the number of downloads increased, the used book price for his book
 increased, as well.</p>
<p>These are examples of using the Commons to better spread proprietary
 content. I believe that is a wonderful and common use of the Commons.
 There are others who use Creative Commons licenses for other reasons.
 Many who use the “sampling license” do so because anything else would
 be hypocritical. The sampling license says that others are free, for
 commercial or noncommercial purposes, to sample content from the
 licensed work; they are just not free to make full copies of the
 licensed work available to others. This is consistent with their own
 art—they, too, sample from others. Because the <i>legal</i> costs of
 sampling are so high (Walter Leaphart, manager of the rap group Public
 Enemy, which was born sampling the music of others, has stated that he
 does not “allow” Public Enemy to sample anymore, because the legal
 costs are so high<noteref noteid="note.us2"/>), these artists release into the creative
 environment content that others can build upon, so that their form of
 creativity might grow.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many who mark their content with a Creative
 Commons license just because they want to express to others the
 importance of balance in this debate. If you just go along with the
 system as it is, you are effectively saying you believe in the “All
 Rights Reserved” model. Good for you, but many do not. Many believe
 that however appropriate that rule is for Hollywood and freaks, it is
 not an appropriate description of how most creators view the rights
 associated with their content. The Creative Commons license expresses
 this notion of “Some Rights Reserved,” and gives many the chance to say
 it to others.</p>
<p>In the first six months of the Creative Commons experiment, over 1
 million objects were licensed with these free-culture licenses. The
 next step is partnerships with middleware content providers to help
 them build into their technologies simple ways for users to mark their
 content with Creative Commons freedoms. Then the next step is to watch
 and celebrate creators who build content based upon content set free.</p>
<p>These are first steps to rebuilding a public domain. They are not
 mere arguments; they are action. Building a public domain is the first
 step to showing people how important that domain is to creativity and
 innovation. Creative Commons relies upon voluntary steps to achieve
 this rebuilding. They will lead to a world in which more than voluntary
 steps are possible.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is just one example of voluntary efforts by
 individuals and creators to change the mix of rights that now govern
 the creative field. The project does not compete with copyright; it
 complements it. Its aim is not to defeat the rights of authors, but to
 make it easier for authors and creators to exercise their rights more
 flexibly and cheaply. That difference, we believe, will enable
 creativity to spread more easily.</p>

<page-sequence>

<h2 id='afterword.2'>THEM, SOON</h2>

<p><b>We will</b> not reclaim a free culture by individual action alone. It
 will also take important reforms of laws. We have a long way to go
 before the politicians will listen to these ideas and implement these
 reforms. But that also means that we have time to build awareness
 around the changes that we need.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I outline five kinds of changes: four that are
 general, and one that’s specific to the most heated battle of the day,
 music. Each is a step, not an end. But any of these steps would carry
 us a long way to our end.</p>

<h2 id='afterword.2.1'>1. More Formalities</h2>

<p>If you buy a house, you have to record the sale in a deed. If you buy
 land upon which to build a house, you have to record the purchase in a
 deed. If you buy a car, you get a bill of sale and register the car. If
 you buy an airplane ticket, it has your name on it.</p>
<p>These are all formalities associated with property. They are
 requirements that we all must bear if we want our property to be
 protected.</p>
<p>In contrast, under current copyright law, you automatically get a
 copyright, regardless of whether you comply with any formality. You
 don’t have to register. You don’t even have to mark your content. The
 default is control, and “formalities” are banished.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>As I suggested in chapter 10, the motivation to abolish formalities
 was a good one. In the world before digital technologies, formalities
 imposed a burden on copyright holders without much benefit. Thus, it
 was progress when the law relaxed the formal requirements that a
 copyright owner must bear to protect and secure his work. Those
 formalities were getting in the way.</p>
<p>But the Internet changes all this. Formalities today need not be a
 burden. Rather, the world without formalities is the world that burdens
 creativity. Today, there is no simple way to know who owns what, or
 with whom one must deal in order to use or build upon the creative work
 of others. There are no records, there is no system to trace—there is
 no simple way to know how to get permission. Yet given the massive
 increase in the scope of copyright’s rule, getting permission is a
 necessary step for any work that builds upon our past. And thus, the<i>
 lack</i> of formalities forces many into silence where they otherwise
 could speak.</p>
<p>The law should therefore change this requirement<noteref noteid="note.them1"/>—but it
 should not change it by going back to the old, broken system. We should
 require formalities, but we should establish a system that will create
 the incentives to minimize the burden of these formalities.</p>
<p>The important formalities are three: marking copyrighted work,
 registering copyrights, and renewing the claim to copyright.
 Traditionally, the first of these three was something the copyright
 owner did; the second two were something the government did. But a
 revised system of formalities would banish the government from the
 process, except for the sole purpose of approving standards developed
 by others.</p>

<h2>REGISTRATION AND RENEWAL</h2>

<p>Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a registration
 with the Copyright Office to register or renew a copyright. When filing
 that registration, the copyright owner paid a fee. As with most
 government agencies, the Copyright Office had little incentive to
 minimize the burden of registration; it also had little incentive to
 minimize the fee. And as the Copyright Office is not a main target of
 government policy-making, the office has historically been terribly
 underfunded. Thus, when people who know something about the process
 hear this idea about formalities, their first reaction is
 panic—nothing could be worse than forcing people to deal with the mess
 that is the Copyright Office.</p>
<p>Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a tradition
 of extraordinary innovation in governmental design, can no longer think
 innovatively about how governmental functions can be designed. Just
 because there is a public purpose to a government role, it doesn’t
 follow that the government must actually administer the role. Instead,
 we should be creating incentives for private parties to serve the
 public, subject to standards that the government sets.</p>
<p>In the context of registration, one obvious model is the Internet.
 There are at least 32 million Web sites registered around the world.
 Domain name owners for these Web sites have to pay a fee to keep their
 registration alive. In the main top-level domains (.com, .org, .net),
 there is a central registry. The actual registrations are, however,
 performed by many competing registrars. That competition drives the
 cost of registering down, and more importantly, it drives the ease with
 which registration occurs up.</p>
<p>We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal of
 copyrights. The Copyright Office may well serve as the central
 registry, but it should not be in the registrar business. Instead, it
 should establish a database, and a set of standards for registrars. It
 should approve registrars that meet its standards. Those registrars
 would then compete with one another to deliver the cheapest and
 simplest systems for registering and renewing copyrights. That
 competition would substantially lower the burden of this
 formality—while producing a database of registrations that would
 facilitate the licensing of content.</p>

<h2>MARKING</h2>

<p>It used to be that the failure to include a copyright notice on a
 creative work meant that the copyright was forfeited. That was a harsh
 punishment for failing to comply with a regulatory rule—akin to
 imposing the death penalty for a parking ticket in the world of
 creative rights. Here again, there is no reason that a marking
 requirement needs to be enforced in this way. And more importantly,
 there is no reason a marking requirement needs to be enforced uniformly
 across all media.</p>
<p>The aim of marking is to signal to the public that this work is
 copyrighted and that the author wants to enforce his rights. The mark
 also makes it easy to locate a copyright owner to secure permission to
 use the work.</p>
<p>One of the problems the copyright system confronted early on was that
 different copyrighted works had to be differently marked. It wasn’t
 clear how or where a statue was to be marked, or a record, or a film. A
 new marking requirement could solve these problems by recognizing the
 differences in media, and by allowing the system of marking to evolve
 as technologies enable it to. The system could enable a special signal
 from the failure to mark—not the loss of the copyright, but the loss
 of the right to punish someone for failing to get permission first.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the last point. If a copyright owner allows his work
 to be published without a copyright notice, the consequence of that
 failure need not be that the copyright is lost. The consequence could
 instead be that anyone has the right to use this work, until the
 copyright owner complains and demonstrates that it is his work and he
 doesn’t give permission.<noteref noteid="note.them2"/> The meaning of an unmarked work
 would therefore be “use unless someone complains.” If someone does
 complain, then the obligation would be to stop using the work in any
 new work from then on though no penalty would attach for existing uses.
 This would create a strong incentive for copyright owners to mark their
 work.</p>
<p>That in turn raises the question about how work should best be
 marked. Here again, the system needs to adjust as the technologies
 evolve. The best way to ensure that the system evolves is to limit the
 Copyright Office’s role to that of approving standards for marking
 content that have been crafted elsewhere.</p>
<p>For example, if a recording industry association devises a method for
 marking CDs, it would propose that to the Copyright Office. The
 Copyright Office would hold a hearing, at which other proposals could
 be made. The Copyright Office would then select the proposal that it
 judged preferable, and it would base that choice <i>solely</i> upon the
 consideration of which method could best be integrated into the
 registration and renewal system. We would not count on the government
 to innovate; but we would count on the government to keep the product
 of innovation in line with its other important functions.</p>
<p>Finally, marking content clearly would simplify registration
 requirements. If photographs were marked by author and year, there
 would be little reason not to allow a photographer to reregister, for
 example, all photographs taken in a particular year in one quick step.
 The aim of the formality is not to burden the creator; the system
 itself should be kept as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The objective of formalities is to make things clear. The existing
 system does nothing to make things clear. Indeed, it seems designed to
 make things unclear.</p>
<p>If formalities such as registration were reinstated, one of the most
 difficult aspects of relying upon the public domain would be removed.
 It would be simple to identify what content is presumptively free; it
 would be simple to identify who controls the rights for a particular
 kind of content; it would be simple to assert those rights, and to
 renew that assertion at the appropriate time.</p>

<h2 id='afterword.2.2'>2. Shorter Terms</h2>
<p>The term of copyright has gone from fourteen years to ninety-five
 years for corporate authors, and life of the author plus seventy years
 for natural authors.</p>
<p>In <i>The Future of Ideas,</i> I proposed a seventy-five-year term,
 granted in five-year increments with a requirement of renewal every
 five years. That seemed radical enough at the time. But after we lost<i>
 Eldred</i> v. <i>Ashcroft,</i> the proposals became even more radical.<i>
 The Economist</i> endorsed a proposal for a fourteen-year copyright
 term.<noteref noteid="note.them3"/> Others have proposed tying the term to the term for
 patents.</p>
<p>I agree with those who believe that we need a radical change in
copy-right’s term. But whether fourteen years or seventy-five, there
are four principles that are important to keep in mind about copyright
terms.</p>
<p>(1) <i>Keep it short:</i> The term should be as long as necessary to
 give incentives to create, but no longer. If it were tied to very
 strong protections for authors (so authors were able to reclaim rights
 from publishers), rights to the same work (not derivative works) might
 be extended further. The key is not to tie the work up with legal
 regulations when it no longer benefits an author.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Keep it simple:</i> The line between the public domain and
 protected content must be kept clear. Lawyers like the fuzziness of
 “fair use,” and the distinction between “ideas” and “expression.” That
 kind of law gives them lots of work. But our framers had a simpler idea
 in mind: protected versus unprotected. The value of short terms is that
 there is little need to build exceptions into copyright when the term
 itself is kept short. A clear and active “lawyer-free zone” makes the
 complexities of “fair use” and “idea/expression” less necessary to
 navigate.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Keep it alive:</i> Copyright should have to be renewed.
 Especially if the maximum term is long, the copyright owner should be
 required to signal periodically that he wants the protection continued.
 This need not be an onerous burden, but there is no reason this
 monopoly protection has to be granted for free. On average, it takes
 ninety minutes for a veteran to apply for a pension.<noteref noteid="note.them4"/> If we
 make veterans suffer that burden, I don’t see why we couldn’t require
 authors to spend ten minutes every fifty years to file a single form.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Keep it prospective:</i> Whatever the term of copyright should
 be, the clearest lesson that economists teach is that a term once given
 should not be extended. It might have been a mistake in 1923 for the
 law to offer authors only a fifty-six-year term. I don’t think so, but
 it’s possible. If it was a mistake, then the consequence was that we
 got fewer authors to create in 1923 than we otherwise would have. But
 we can’t correct that mistake today by increasing the term. No matter
 what we do today, we will not increase the number of authors who wrote
 in 1923. Of course, we can increase the reward that those who write now
 get (or alternatively, increase the copyright burden that smothers many
 works that are today invisible). But increasing their reward will not
 increase their creativity in 1923. What’s not done is not done, and
 there’s nothing we can do about that now.</p>
<p>These changes together should produce an <i>average</i> copyright
 term that is much shorter than the current term. Until 1976, the
 average term was just 32.2 years. We should be aiming for the same.</p>
<p>No doubt the extremists will call these ideas “radical.” (After all,
 I call them “extremists.”) But again, the term I recommended was longer
 than the term under Richard Nixon. How “radical” can it be to ask for a
 more generous copyright law than Richard Nixon presided over?</p>

<h2 id='afterword.2.3'>3. Free Use Vs. Fair Use</h2>
<p>As I observed at the beginning of this book, property law originally
 granted property owners the right to control their property from the
 ground to the heavens. The airplane came along. The scope of property
 rights quickly changed. There was no fuss, no constitutional challenge.
 It made no sense anymore to grant that much control, given the
 emergence of that new technology.</p>
<p>Our Constitution gives Congress the power to give authors “exclusive
 right” to “their writings.” Congress has given authors an exclusive
 right to “their writings” plus any derivative writings (made by others)
 that are sufficiently close to the author’s original work. Thus, if I
 write a book, and you base a movie on that book, I have the power to
 deny you the right to release that movie, even though that movie is not
 “my writing.”</p>
<p>Congress granted the beginnings of this right in 1870, when it
 expanded the exclusive right of copyright to include a right to control
 translations and dramatizations of a work.<noteref noteid="note.them5"/> The courts have
 expanded it slowly through judicial interpretation ever since. This
 expansion has been commented upon by one of the law’s greatest judges,
 Judge Benjamin Kaplan.</p>
<p>So inured have we become to the extension of the monopoly to a large
 range of so-called derivative works, that we no longer sense the oddity
 of accepting such an enlargement of copyright while yet intoning the
 abracadabra of idea and expression.<noteref noteid="note.them6"/></p>
<p>I think it’s time to recognize that there are airplanes in this field
 and the expansiveness of these rights of derivative use no longer make
 sense. More precisely, they don’t make sense for the period of time
 that a copyright runs. And they don’t make sense as an amorphous grant.
 Consider each limitation in turn.</p>

<p><i>Term:</i> If Congress wants to grant a derivative right, then that right
 should be for a much shorter term. It makes sense to protect John
 Grisham’s right to sell the movie rights to his latest novel (or at
 least I’m willing to assume it does); but it does not make sense for
 that right to run for the same term as the underlying copyright. The
 derivative right could be important in inducing creativity; it is not
 important long after the creative work is done.</p>
<p><i>Scope: </i> Likewise should the scope of derivative rights be narrowed. Again,
 there are some cases in which derivative rights are important. Those
 should be specified. But the law should draw clear lines around
 regulated and unregulated uses of copyrighted material. When all
 “reuse” of creative material was within the control of businesses,
 perhaps it made sense to require lawyers to negotiate the lines. It no
 longer makes sense for lawyers to negotiate the lines. Think about all
 the creative possibilities that digital technologies enable; now
 imagine pouring molasses into the machines. That’s what this general
 requirement of permission does to the creative process. Smothers it.
</p><p>This was the point that Alben made when describing the making of the
 Clint Eastwood CD. While it makes sense to require negotiation for
 foreseeable derivative rights—turning a book into a movie, or a poem
 into a musical score—it doesn’t make sense to require negotiation for
 the unforeseeable. Here, a statutory right would make much more sense.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, the law should mark the uses that are
 protected, and the presumption should be that other uses are not
 protected. This is the reverse of the recommendation of my colleague
 Paul Goldstein.<noteref noteid="note.them7"/> His view is that the law should be written
 so that expanded protections follow expanded uses.</p>
<p>Goldstein’s analysis would make perfect sense if the cost of the
 legal system were small. But as we are currently seeing in the context
 of the Internet, the uncertainty about the scope of protection, and the
 incentives to protect existing architectures of revenue, combined with
 a strong copyright, weaken the process of innovation.</p>
<p>The law could remedy this problem either by removing protection
 beyond the part explicitly drawn or by granting reuse rights upon
 certain statutory conditions. Either way, the effect would be to free a
 great deal of culture to others to cultivate. And under a statutory
 rights regime, that reuse would earn artists more income.</p>

<h2 id='afterword.2.4'>4. Liberate the Music—Again</h2>
<p>The battle that got this whole war going was about music, so it
 wouldn’t be fair to end this book without addressing the issue that is,
 to most people, most pressing—music. There is no other policy issue
 that better teaches the lessons of this book than the battles around
 the sharing of music.</p>
<p>The appeal of file-sharing music was the crack cocaine of the
Internet’s growth. It drove demand for access to the Internet more
powerfully than any other single application. It was the Internet’s
killer app—possibly in two senses of that word. It no doubt was the
application that drove demand for bandwidth. It may well be the
application that drives demand for regulations that in the end kill
innovation on the network.</p>
<p>The aim of copyright, with respect to content in general and music in
 particular, is to create the incentives for music to be composed,
 performed, and, most importantly, spread. The law does this by giving
 an exclusive right to a composer to control public performances of his
 work, and to a performing artist to control copies of her performance.</p>
<p>File-sharing networks complicate this model by enabling the spread of
 content for which the performer has not been paid. But of course,
 that’s not all the file-sharing networks do. As I described in chapter
 5, they enable four different kinds of sharing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A. There are some who are using sharing networks as substitutes for
 purchasing CDs.</p>

<p>B. There are also some who are using sharing networks to sample, on
 the way to purchasing CDs.</p>

<p>C. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get access
 to content that is no longer sold but is still under copyright or that
 would have been too cumbersome to buy off the Net.</p>

<p>D. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get access
 to content that is not copyrighted or to get access that the copyright
 owner plainly endorses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any reform of the law needs to keep these different uses in focus. It must avoid burdening type D even if it aims to eliminate type A. The eagerness with which the law aims to eliminate type A, moreover, should depend upon the magnitude of type B. As with VCRs, if the net effect of sharing is actually not very harmful, the need for regulation is significantly weakened.</p>
<p>As I said in chapter 5, the actual harm caused by sharing is controversial. For the purposes of this chapter, however, I assume the harm is real. I assume, in other words, that type A sharing is significantly greater than type B, and is the dominant use of sharing networks.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a crucial fact about the current technological context that we must keep in mind if we are to understand how the law should respond.</p>
<p>Today, file sharing is addictive. In ten years, it won’t be. It is addictive today because it is the easiest way to gain access to a broad range of content. It won’t be the easiest way to get access to a broad range of content in ten years. Today, access to the Internet is cumbersome and slow—we in the United States are lucky to have broadband service at 1.5 MBs, and very rarely do we get service at that speed both up and down. Although wireless access is growing, most of us still get access across wires. Most only gain access through a machine with a keyboard. The idea of the always on, always connected Internet is mainly just an idea.</p>
<p>But it will become a reality, and that means the way we get access to the Internet today is a technology in transition. Policy makers should not make policy on the basis of technology in transition. They should make policy on the basis of where the technology is going. The question should not be, how should the law regulate sharing in this world? The question should be, what law will we require when the network becomes the network it is clearly becoming? That network is one in which every machine with electricity is essentially on the Net; where everywhere you are—except maybe the desert or the Rockies—you can instantaneously be connected to the Internet. Imagine the Internet as ubiquitous as the best cell-phone service, where with the flip of a device, you are connected.</p>
<p>In that world, it will be extremely easy to connect to services that give you access to content on the fly—such as Internet radio, content that is streamed to the user when the user demands. Here, then, is the critical point: When it is <i>extremely</i> easy to connect to services that give access to content, it will be <i>easier</i> to connect to services that give you access to content than it will be to download and store content <i>on the many devices you will have for playing content</i>. It will be easier, in other words, to subscribe than it will be to be a database manager, as everyone in the download-sharing world of Napster-like technologies essentially is. Content services will compete with content sharing, even if the services charge money for the content they give access to. Already cell-phone services in Japan offer music (for a fee) streamed over cell phones (enhanced with plugs for headphones). The Japanese are paying for this content even though “free” content is available in the form of MP3s across the Web.<noteref noteid="note.them8"/></p>
<p>This point about the future is meant to suggest a perspective on the present: It is emphatically temporary. The “problem” with file sharing—to the extent there is a real problem—is a problem that will increasingly disappear as it becomes easier to connect to the Internet. And thus it is an extraordinary mistake for policy makers today to be “solving” this problem in light of a technology that will be gone tomorrow. The question should not be how to regulate the Internet to eliminate file sharing (the Net will evolve that problem away). The question instead should be how to assure that artists get paid, during this transition between twentieth-century models for doing business and twenty-first-century technologies.</p>
<p>The answer begins with recognizing that there are different “problems” here to solve. Let’s start with type D content—uncopyrighted content or copyrighted content that the artist wants shared. The “problem” with this content is to make sure that the technology that would enable this kind of sharing is not rendered illegal. You can think of it this way: Pay phones are used to deliver ransom demands, no doubt. But there are many who need to use pay phones who have nothing to do with ransoms. It would be wrong to ban pay phones in order to eliminate kidnapping.</p>
<p>Type C content raises a different “problem.” This is content that was, at one time, published and is no longer available. It may be unavailable because the artist is no longer valuable enough for the record label he signed with to carry his work. Or it may be unavailable because the work is forgotten. Either way, the aim of the law should be to facilitate the access to this content, ideally in a way that returns something to the artist.</p>
<p>Again, the model here is the used book store. Once a book goes out of print, it may still be available in libraries and used book stores. But libraries and used book stores don’t pay the copyright owner when someone reads or buys an out-of-print book. That makes total sense, of course, since any other system would be so burdensome as to eliminate the possibility of used book stores’ existing. But from the author’s perspective, this “sharing” of his content without his being compensated is less than ideal.</p>
<p>The model of used book stores suggests that the law could simply deem out-of-print music fair game. If the publisher does not make copies of the music available for sale, then commercial and noncommercial providers would be free, under this rule, to “share” that content, even though the sharing involved making a copy. The copy here would be incidental to the trade; in a context where commercial publishing has ended, trading music should be as free as trading books.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the law could create a statutory license that would ensure that artists get something from the trade of their work. For example, if the law set a low statutory rate for the commercial sharing of content that was not offered for sale by a commercial publisher, and if that rate were automatically transferred to a trust for the benefit of the artist, then businesses could develop around the idea of trading this content, and artists would benefit from this trade.</p>
<p>This system would also create an incentive for publishers to keep works available commercially. Works that are available commercially would not be subject to this license. Thus, publishers could protect the right to charge whatever they want for content if they kept the work commercially available. But if they don’t keep it available, and instead, the computer hard disks of fans around the world keep it alive, then any royalty owed for such copying should be much less than the amount owed a commercial publisher.</p>
<p>The hard case is content of types A and B, and again, this case is hard only because the extent of the problem will change over time, as the technologies for gaining access to content change. The law’s solution should be as flexible as the problem is, understanding that we are in the middle of a radical transformation in the technology for delivering and accessing content.</p>
<p>So here’s a solution that will at first seem very strange to both sides in this war, but which upon reflection, I suggest, should make some sense.</p>
<p>Stripped of the rhetoric about the sanctity of property, the basic claim of the content industry is this: A new technology (the Internet) has harmed a set of rights that secure copyright. If those rights are to be protected, then the content industry should be compensated for that harm. Just as the technology of tobacco harmed the health of millions of Americans, or the technology of asbestos caused grave illness to thousands of miners, so, too, has the technology of digital networks harmed the interests of the content industry.</p>
<p>I love the Internet, and so I don’t like likening it to tobacco or asbestos. But the analogy is a fair one from the perspective of the law. And it suggests a fair response: Rather than seeking to destroy the Internet, or the p2p technologies that are currently harming content providers on the Internet, we should find a relatively simple way to compensate those who are harmed.</p>
<p>The idea would be a modification of a proposal that has been floated by Harvard law professor William Fisher.<noteref noteid="note.them9"/> Fisher suggests a very clever way around the current impasse of the Internet. Under his plan, all content capable of digital transmission would (1) be marked with a digital watermark (don’t worry about how easy it is to evade these marks; as you’ll see, there’s no incentive to evade them). Once the content is marked, then entrepreneurs would develop (2) systems to monitor how many items of each content were distributed. On the basis of those numbers, then (3) artists would be compensated. The compensation would be paid for by (4) an appropriate tax.</p>
<p>Fisher’s proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a million questions, most of which he answers well in his upcoming book, <i>Promises to Keep.</i> The modification that I would make is relatively simple: Fisher imagines his proposal replacing the existing copyright system. I imagine it complementing the existing system. The aim of the proposal would be to facilitate compensation to the extent that harm could be shown. This compensation would be temporary, aimed at facilitating a transition between regimes. And it would require renewal after a period of years. If it continues to make sense to facilitate free exchange of content, supported through a taxation system, then it can be continued. If this form of protection is no longer necessary, then the system could lapse into the old system of controlling access.</p>
<p>Fisher would balk at the idea of allowing the system to lapse. His aim is not just to ensure that artists are paid, but also to ensure that the system supports the widest range of “semiotic democracy” possible. But the aims of semiotic democracy would be satisfied if the other changes I described were accomplished—in particular, the limits on derivative uses. A system that simply charges for access would not greatly burden semiotic democracy if there were few limitations on what one was allowed to do with the content itself.</p>
<p>No doubt it would be difficult to calculate the proper measure of “harm” to an industry. But the difficulty of making that calculation would be outweighed by the benefit of facilitating innovation. This background system to compensate would also not need to interfere with innovative proposals such as Apple’s MusicStore. As experts predicted when Apple launched the MusicStore, it could beat “free” by being easier than free is. This has proven correct: Apple has sold millions of songs at even the very high price of 99 cents a song. (At 99 cents, the cost is the equivalent of a per-song CD price, though the labels have none of the costs of a CD to pay.) Apple’s move was countered by Real Networks, offering music at just 79 cents a song. And no doubt there will be a great deal of competition to offer and sell music on-line.</p>
<p>This competition has already occurred against the background of “free” music from p2p systems. As the sellers of cable television have known for thirty years, and the sellers of bottled water for much more than that, there is nothing impossible at all about “competing with free.” Indeed, if anything, the competition spurs the competitors to offer new and better products. This is precisely what the competitive market was to be about. Thus in Singapore, though piracy is rampant, movie theaters are often luxurious—with “first class” seats, and meals served while you watch a movie—as they struggle and succeed in finding ways to compete with “free.”</p>
<p>This regime of competition, with a backstop to assure that artists don’t lose, would facilitate a great deal of innovation in the delivery of content. That competition would continue to shrink type A sharing. It would inspire an extraordinary range of new innovators—ones who would have a right to the content, and would no longer fear the uncertain and barbarically severe punishments of the law.</p>
<p>In summary, then, my proposal is this:</p>
<p>The Internet is in transition. We should not be regulating a technology in transition. We should instead be regulating to minimize the harm to interests affected by this technological change, while enabling, and encouraging, the most efficient technology we can create.</p>
<p>We can minimize that harm while maximizing the benefit to innovation by</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. guaranteeing the right to engage in type D sharing;</p>

<p>2. permitting noncommercial type C sharing without liability, and commercial type C sharing at a low and fixed rate set by statute;</p>

<p>3. while in this transition, taxing and compensating for type A sharing, to the extent actual harm is demonstrated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what if “piracy” doesn’t disappear? What if there is a competitive market providing content at a low cost, but a significant number of consumers continue to “take” content for nothing? Should the law do something then?</p>
<p>Yes, it should. But, again, what it should do depends upon how the facts develop. These changes may not eliminate type A sharing. But the real issue is not whether it eliminates sharing in the abstract. The real issue is its effect on the market. Is it better (a) to have a technology that is 95 percent secure and produces a market of size <i>x,</i> or (b) to have a technology that is 50 percent secure but produces a market of five times <i>x</i>? Less secure might produce more unauthorized sharing, but it is likely to also produce a much bigger market in authorized sharing. The most important thing is to assure artists’ compensation without breaking the Internet. Once that’s assured, then it may well be appropriate to find ways to track down the petty pirates.</p>
<p>But we’re a long way away from whittling the problem down to this subset of type A sharers. And our focus until we’re there should not be on finding ways to break the Internet. Our focus until we’re there should be on how to make sure the artists are paid, while protecting the space for innovation and creativity that the Internet is.</p>

<h2 id='afterword.2.5'>5. Fire Lots of Lawyers</h2>

<p>I’m a lawyer. I make lawyers for a living. I believe in the law. I believe in the law of copyright. Indeed, I have devoted my life to working in law, not because there are big bucks at the end but because there are ideals at the end that I would love to live.</p>
<p>Yet much of this book has been a criticism of lawyers, or the role lawyers have played in this debate. The law speaks to ideals, but it is my view that our profession has become too attuned to the client. And in a world where the rich clients have one strong view, the unwillingness of the profession to question or counter that one strong view queers the law.</p>
<p>The evidence of this bending is compelling. I’m attacked as a “radical” by many within the profession, yet the positions that I am advocating are precisely the positions of some of the most moderate and significant figures in the history of this branch of the law. Many, for example, thought crazy the challenge that we brought to the Copyright Term Extension Act. Yet just thirty years ago, the dominant scholar and practitioner in the field of copyright, Melville Nimmer, thought it obvious.<noteref noteid="note.them10"/></p>
<p>However, my criticism of the role that lawyers have played in this debate is not just about a professional bias. It is more importantly about our failure to actually reckon the costs of the law.</p>
<p>Economists are supposed to be good at reckoning costs and benefits. But more often than not, economists, with no clue about how the legal system actually functions, simply assume that the transaction costs of the legal system are slight.<noteref noteid="note.them11"/> They see a system that has been around for hundreds of years, and they assume it works the way their elementary school civics class taught them it works.</p>
<p>But the legal system doesn’t work. Or more accurately, it doesn’t work for anyone except those with the most resources. Not because the system is corrupt. I don’t think our legal system (at the federal level, at least) is at all corrupt. I mean simply because the costs of our legal system are so astonishingly high that justice can practically never be done.</p>
<p>These costs distort free culture in many ways. A lawyer’s time is billed at the largest firms at more than $400 per hour. How much time should such a lawyer spend reading cases carefully, or researching obscure strands of authority? The answer is the increasing reality: very little. The law depended upon the careful articulation and development of doctrine, but the careful articulation and development of legal doctrine depends upon careful work. Yet that careful work costs too much, except in the most high-profile and costly cases.</p>
<p>The costliness and clumsiness and randomness of this system mock our tradition. And lawyers, as well as academics, should consider it their duty to change the way the law works—or better, to change the law so that it works. It is wrong that the system works well only for the top 1 percent of the clients. It could be made radically more efficient, and inexpensive, and hence radically more just.</p>
<p>But until that reform is complete, we as a society should keep the law away from areas that we know it will only harm. And that is precisely what the law will too often do if too much of our culture is left to its review.</p>
<p>Think about the amazing things your kid could do or make with digital technology—the film, the music, the Web page, the blog. Or think about the amazing things your community could facilitate with digital technology—a wiki, a barn raising, activism to change something. Think about all those creative things, and then imagine cold molasses poured onto the machines. This is what any regime that requires permission produces. Again, this is the reality of Brezhnev’s Russia.</p>
<p>The law should regulate in certain areas of culture—but it should regulate culture only where that regulation does good. Yet lawyers rarely test their power, or the power they promote, against this simple pragmatic question: “Will it do good?” When challenged about the expanding reach of the law, the lawyer answers, “Why not?”</p>
<p>We should ask, “Why?” Show me why your regulation of culture is needed. Show me how it does good. And until you can show me both, keep your lawyers away.</p>

The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement obligates member nations to create administrative and enforcement mechanisms for intellectual property rights, a costly proposition for developing countries. Additionally, patent rights may lead to higher prices for staple industries such as agriculture. Critics of TRIPS question the disparity between burdens imposed upon developing countries and benefits conferred to industrialized nations. TRIPS does permit governments to use patents for public, noncommercial uses without first obtaining the patent holder’s permission. Developing nations may be able to use this to gain the benefits of foreign patents at lower prices. This is a promising strategy for developing nations within the TRIPS framework.</p></note>

<note id="note.chap5.24" label="24"><p>These are the most important instances in our history, but there are other cases as well. The technology of digital audio tape (DAT), for example, was regulated by Congress to minimize the risk of piracy. The remedy Congress imposed did burden DAT producers, by taxing tape sales and controlling the technology of DAT. See Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 (Title 17 of the <i>United States Code</i>), Pub. L. No. 102-563, 106 Stat. 4237, codified at 17 U.S.C. §1001.

<note id="note.chap10.2" label="2"><p>Lawyers speak of “property” not as an absolute thing, but as a bundle of rights that are sometimes associated with a particular object. Thus, my “property right” to my car gives me the right to exclusive use, but not the right to drive at 150 miles an hour. For the best effort to connect the ordinary meaning of “property” to “lawyer talk,” see Bruce Ackerman, <i>Private Property and the Constitution</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977), 26-27.</p></note>
<note id="note.chap10.3" label="3"><p>By describing the way law affects the other three modalities, I don’t mean to suggest that the other three don’t affect law. Obviously, they do. Law’s only distinction is that it alone speaks as if it has a right self-consciously to change the other three. The right of the other three is more timidly expressed. See Lawrence Lessig, <i>Code: And Other Laws of Cyberspace</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1999): 90-95; Lawrence Lessig, “The New Chicago School,” <i>Journal of Legal Studies,</i> June 1998.</p></note>
<note id="note.chap10.4" label="4"><p>Some people object to this way of talking about “liberty.” They object because their focus when considering the constraints that exist at any particular moment are constraints imposed exclusively by the government. For instance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people think it is meaningless to say that one’s liberty has been restrained. A bridge has washed out, and it’s harder to get from one place to another. To talk about this as a loss of freedom, they say, is to confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries of ordinary life.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to deny the value in this narrower view, which depends upon the context of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to argue against any insistence that this narrower view is the only proper view of liberty. As I argued in <i>Code,</i> we come from a long tradition of political thought with a broader focus than the narrow question of what the government did when. John Stuart Mill defended freedom of speech, for example, from the tyranny of narrow minds, not from the fear of government prosecution; John Stuart Mill, <i>On Liberty</i> (Indiana: Hackett Publishing Co., 1978), 19. John R. Commons famously defended the economic freedom of labor from constraints imposed by the market; John R. Commons, “The Right to Work,” in Malcom Rutherford and Warren J. Samuels, eds., <i>John R. Commons: Selected Essays</i> (London: Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans with Disabilities Act increases the liberty of people with physical disabilities by changing the architecture of certain public places, thereby making access to those places easier; 42 <i>United States Code</i>, section 12101 (2000). Each of these interventions to change existing conditions changes the liberty of a particular group. The effect of those interventions should be accounted for in order to understand the effective liberty that each of these groups might face.</p></note>

<note id="note.chap10.9" label="9"><p>Although 13,000 titles were published in the United States from 1790 to 1799, only 556 copyright registrations were filed; John Tebbel, <i>A History of Book Publishing in the United States,</i> vol. 1, <i>The Creation of an Industry, 1630-1865</i> (New York: Bowker, 1972), 141.

Thus, the overwhelming majority of works fell immediately into the public domain. Even those works that were copyrighted fell into the public domain quickly, because the term of copyright was short.

<note id="note.chap10.16" label="16"><p>This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one. The law certainly regulates more than “copies”—a public performance of a copyrighted song, for example, is regulated even though performance per se doesn’t make a copy; 17 <i>United States Code,</i> section 106(4). And it certainly sometimes doesn’t regulate a “copy”; 17 <i>United States Code,</i> section 112(a). But the presumption under the existing law (which regulates “copies;” 17 <i>United States Code,</i> section 102) is that if there is a copy, there is a right.</p></note>
<note id="note.chap10.17" label="17"><p>Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright law extends, we should repeal it.

Civil penalties are currently set at $150,000 per copied song.

Such astronomical figures furnish the RIAA with a powerful arsenal in its prosecution of file sharers.

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN: ELDRED</h2>

<notes>
<note id="note.chap13.1" label="1"><p>There’s a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard to describe, but it’s a strong one. One phenomenon that the Internet created was a world of noncommercial pornographers—people who were distributing porn but were not making money directly or indirectly from that distribution. Such a class didn’t exist before the Internet came into being because the costs of distributing porn were so high. Yet this new class of distributors got special attention in the Supreme Court, when the Court struck down the Communications Decency Act of 1996. It was partly because of the burden on noncommercial speakers that the statute was found to exceed Congress’s power. The same point could have been made about noncommercial publishers after the advent of the Internet. The Eric Eldreds of the world before the Internet were extremely few. Yet one would think it at least as important to protect the Eldreds of the world as to protect noncommercial pornographers.</p></note>

The same point is true in the context of the Copyright Clause.

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN: ELDRED II</h2>

<notes>
<note id="note.chap14.1" label="1"><p>Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national copyright legislation sometimes made protection depend upon compliance with formalities such as registration, deposit, and affixation of notice of the author’s claim of copyright. However, starting with the 1908 act, every text of the Convention has provided that “the enjoyment and the exercise” of rights guaranteed by the Convention “shall not be subject to any formality.” The prohibition against formalities is presently embodied in Article 5(2) of the Paris Text of the Berne Convention. Many countries continue to impose some form of deposit or registration requirement, albeit not as a condition of copyright. French law, for example, requires the deposit of copies of works in national repositories, principally the National Museum. Copies of books published in the United Kingdom must be deposited in the British Library. The German Copyright Act provides for a Registrar of Authors where the author’s true name can be filed in the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works.

Professor Netanel has proposed a related idea that would exempt noncommercial sharing from the reach of copyright and would establish compensation to artists to balance any loss. See Neil Weinstock Netanel, “Impose a Noncommercial Use Levy to Allow Free P2P File Sharing,” available at link #79. For other proposals, see Lawrence Lessig, “Who’s Holding Back Broadband?” <i>Washington Post,</i> 8 January 2002, A17; Philip S. Corwin on behalf of Sharman Networks, A Letter to Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 26 February 2002, available at link #80; Serguei Osokine, <i>A Quick Case for Intellectual Property Use Fee (IPUF),</i> 3 March 2002, available at link #81; Jefferson Graham, “Kazaa, Verizon Propose to Pay Artists Directly,” <i>USA Today,</i>13 May 2002, available at link #82; Steven M.

<p>Fisher’s proposal is very similar to Richard Stallman’s proposal for DAT. Unlike Fisher’s, Stallman’s proposal would not pay artists directly proportionally, though more popular artists would get more than the less popular. As is typical with Stallman, his proposal predates the current debate by about a decade. See link #85.</p></note>

<note id="note.them11" label="11"><p>A good example is the work of Professor Stan Liebowitz. Liebowitz is to be commended for his careful review of data about infringement, leading him to question his own publicly stated position—twice. He initially predicted that downloading would substantially harm the industry. He then revised his view in light of the data, and he has since revised his view again. Compare Stan J. Liebowitz, <i>Rethinking the Network Economy: The True Forces That Drive the Digital Marketplace</i> (New York: Amacom, 2002), 173 (reviewing his original view but expressing skepticism) with Stan J. Liebowitz, “Will MP3s Annihilate the Record Industry?” working paper, June 2003, available at link #86.</p>
<p>Liebowitz’s careful analysis is extremely valuable in estimating the effect of file-sharing technology. In my view, however, he underestimates the costs of the legal system. See, for example, <i>Rethinking,</i> 174-76.</p></note>

<h1 id='acknowledgments'>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h1>

<p>This book is the product of a long and as yet unsuccessful struggle that began when I read of Eric Eldred’s war to keep books free. Eldred’s work helped launch a movement, the free culture movement, and it is to him that this book is dedicated.</p>
<p>I received guidance in various places from friends and academics, including Glenn Brown, Peter DiCola, Jennifer Mnookin, Richard Posner, Mark Rose, and Kathleen Sullivan. And I received correction and guidance from many amazing students at Stanford Law School and Stanford University. They included Andrew B. Coan, John Eden, James P. Fellers, Christopher Guzelian, Erica Goldberg, Robert Hallman, Andrew Harris, Matthew Kahn, Brian Link, Ohad Mayblum, Alina Ng, and Erica Platt. I am particularly grateful to Catherine Crump and Harry Surden, who helped direct their research, and to Laura Lynch, who brilliantly managed the army that they assembled, and provided her own critical eye on much of this.</p>
<p>Yuko Noguchi helped me to understand the laws of Japan as well as its culture. I am thankful to her, and to the many in Japan who helped me prepare this book: Joi Ito, Takayuki Matsutani, Naoto Misaki, Michihiro Sasaki, Hiromichi Tanaka, Hiroo Yamagata, and Yoshihiro Yonezawa. I am thankful as well as to Professor Nobuhiro Nakayama, and the Tokyo University Business Law Center, for giving me the chance to spend time in Japan, and to Tadashi Shiraishi and Kiyokazu Yamagami for their generous help while I was there.</p>
<p>These are the traditional sorts of help that academics regularly draw upon. But in addition to them, the Internet has made it possible to receive advice and correction from many whom I have never even met. Among those who have responded with extremely helpful advice to requests on my blog about the book are Dr. Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, David Gerstein, and Peter DiMauro, as well as a long list of those who had specific ideas about ways to develop my argument. They included Richard Bondi, Steven Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob Devine, Charles Eicher, Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy Hunsinger, Vaughn Iverson, John Karabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lindenschmidt, K. L. Mann, Mark Manning, Nora McCauley, Jeffrey McHugh, Evan McMullen, Fred Norton, John Pormann, Pedro A. D. Rezende, Shabbir Safdar, Saul Schleimer, Clay Shirky, Adam Shostack, Kragen Sitaker, Chris Smith, Bruce Steinberg, Andrzej Jan Taramina, Sean Walsh, Matt Wasserman, Miljenko Williams, “Wink,” Roger Wood, “Ximmbo da Jazz,” and Richard Yanco. (I apologize if I have missed anyone; with computers come glitches, and a crash of my e-mail system meant I lost a bunch of great replies.)</p>
<p>Richard Stallman and Michael Carroll each read the whole book in draft, and each provided extremely helpful correction and advice. Michael helped me to see more clearly the significance of the regulation of derivitive works. And Richard corrected an embarrassingly large number of errors. While my work is in part inspired by Stallman’s, he does not agree with me in important places throughout this book.</p>
<p>Finally, and forever, I am thankful to Bettina, who has always insisted that there would be unending happiness away from these battles, and who has always been right. This slow learner is, as ever, grateful for her perpetual patience and love.</p>
